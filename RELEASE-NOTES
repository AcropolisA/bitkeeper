Release notes for BitKeeper version XXX (released ##-XXX-2007)

bk changes
    extended dspecs, search path, etc
    (also prs & log)

bk clean
    The clean code is now smarter about handling files that were
    edited without being locked properly.

bk clone -l
    The hardlink clone code now behaves much more like the normal
    clone in subtle ways.  For example differences in triggers are
    gone, and files are listed instead of directories.

bk takepatch
    Addressed a performance issue on large pulls over NFS or in other
    cases where we have a slow local filesystem.  BitKeeper now does
    significantly less disk IO.

bk pull
    pull -u now spawns changes -L if the pull fails.

bk push
    Now support 'bk push -rREV URL' to only push a subset of the local
    repository to a remote location

---------------
Misc fixes

- Allow the nosync config option to also prevent calls to fsync when
  SCCS files are written.

- Fixed some bugs related to compression over a ssh transport.
  Avoid multiple compression passes.

- Windows now flush modified data on the disk after a resolve has
  completely applying new changes.  This matches the unix behavior.
  This flush can be disabled with the nosync config option.

- Fix a long standing bug in the file urls.  We don't support
  non-absolute path file URLs, all file://whatever means whatever is
  treated as /whatever.  But that should have been file:///whatever.
  Oops.  We do support relative paths, such as ../project, but not in
  a file:// form.
  Now the code accepts either file://whatever or file:///whatever, but
  only generates the last form.

- BitKeeper now always uses unique names in the BitKeeper/deleted
  directory and avoids lots of rename conflicts in some cases.

- XXX tcl/tk was updated.  Don't know what that means.

- BitKeeper will now refuse to run a different version of bk as a
  subprocess.  We have had cases where users have forgotten to restart
  their bkd's after upgrade BitKeeper and this cases bugs.  BitKeeper
  will now notice this and error until the bkd is restarted.

Environment variables that are used to control BitKeeper's behavior
can not longer be set to an empty string.  So for example:
  BK_NO_TRIGGERS="" bk push
won't work.  Use BK_NO_TRIGGERS=1 instead.

Bugs fixed

    2007-12-10-001 'bk mv a/ b/' failed because of the extra slash
    2008-07-16-001 'bk sfiles -U dir' didn't correctly skip bk files
    2008-05-01-001 failed push to an unrelated package would exit 0
