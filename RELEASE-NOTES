Release notes for BitKeeper beta 6

This version of bk stores deleted files in subdirectories under
BitKeeper/deleted to avoid problems with filesystems that have
problems with large numbers of files in a single directory.  An
example filename is like this:
	BitKeeper/deleted/07/slib.c~f3733b2c327712e5
	2 hex digits, the basename of the 1.1 delta, and the random
	bits for this file

While not required, if you are experiencing performance problems in
your deleted directory you can try this:
    bk -rBitKeeper/deleted rm -f
    bk commit -y'mv deleted files'

Create one cset like this and allow it to propagate around.

===============================================================================
Release notes for BitKeeper beta 5

This is a bugfix and partition performance release.

bk partition
    Add a -j<parallel-processes> option to help partition run faster.
    If the user has GNU make installed, then partition can create
    components in parallel.  This helps when using a multi core processor.

bk prompt (GUI version)
    Fix a window geometry problem.

bk commit - fix how pending comments are accumulated, which in certain
cases after using attach, would be wrong.

MS Windows - when working in a repository where the SCCS directories
have been hidden in the .bk directory, mark the .bk directory as hidden,
in the same way that SCCS directories were marked hidden in an existing
bk repository.

===============================================================================
Release notes for BitKeeper beta 4

bk bam server <NEWURL>
    This now works in a nested repository.

bk checksum ChangeSet
    Performance is enhanced.  Verifying checksum integrity
    for all csets in a ChangeSet file requires many passes over the
    data.  Checksums are now calculated more efficiently.
    This will help bk partition.

bk csetprune
    Performance is enhanced.  Running csetprune can remove
    csets from the history, leading to re-structuring of the graph.
    Previous, that was done in a straight forward, but inefficient
    manner, which was fine since csetprune wasn't used often.  With
    partition, csetprune performance is critical, and the graph
    restructuring computation is now more efficient.

bk fix -c
    This now works in a nested repository.

bk needscheck [-v]
    Returns true if the repository is configured for partial_check and
    would run a full check.

bk partition
    Besides running faster (see bk checksum and bk csetprune),
    partition now transforms the gone file.  Previous versions required
    pruning out missing files.  This version still allows pruning,
    but doesn't require it. 

Other changes

bk-4.6 was released, and those changes have been integrated into this
release.

progress bars
    The push, pull, clone, and undo commands have been reworked
    to have progress bars instead of listing out files being worked on.
    The previous behavior is still available by using the -v option.

triggers
    The exit codes from post-commit triggers are ignored.

===============================================================================
Release notes for BitKeeper beta 3

Performance groundwork in clones, pushes and pulls.  We are working
on more which builds on the changes in this release.

bk version
    Work on a remote repository: bk version <url>

bk repocheck
    a shorthand for running check in a standalone or nested collection.
    Easier to remember than bk -Ar check -vac

bk id
    New option '-5' - return the repo rootkey as an md5key.

bk citool
    Significant changes for use in a nested collection.
    Give it a try, please, and let us know what you think.

===============================================================================
Release notes for BitKeeper beta 2

Minor bugfixes and polish.  Do fewer stats of the file system.

Release notes for BitKeeper beta

This is a preview of a major release of BitKeeper

BK-Nested - supports organizing a collection of repositories.
This support scaling by linking many repositories together but
not requiring all repositories be present.

SCCS directories are no longer stored each directory in the repository.

Command level changes:

bk changes
    extended dspecs, search path, etc
    (also prs & log)

bk clean
    The clean code is now smarter about handling files that were
    edited without being locked properly.

bk clone -l
    The hardlink clone code now behaves much more like the normal
    clone in subtle ways.  For example differences in triggers are
    gone, and files are listed instead of directories.

bk takepatch
    Addressed a performance issue on large pulls over NFS or in other
    cases where we have a slow local filesystem.  BitKeeper now does
    significantly less disk IO.

bk pull
    pull -u now spawns changes -L if the pull fails.

bk push
    Now support 'bk push -rREV URL' to only push a subset of the local
    repository to a remote location

---------------
Misc fixes

- Allow the nosync config option to also prevent calls to fsync when
  SCCS files are written.

- Fixed some bugs related to compression over a ssh transport.
  Avoid multiple compression passes.

- Windows now flush modified data on the disk after a resolve has
  completely applying new changes.  This matches the unix behavior.
  This flush can be disabled with the nosync config option.

- Fix a long standing bug in the file urls.  We don't support
  non-absolute path file URLs, all file://whatever means whatever is
  treated as /whatever.  But that should have been file:///whatever.
  Oops.  We do support relative paths, such as ../project, but not in
  a file:// form.
  Now the code accepts either file://whatever or file:///whatever, but
  only generates the last form.

- BitKeeper now always uses unique names in the BitKeeper/deleted
  directory and avoids lots of rename conflicts in some cases.

- BitKeeper will now refuse to run a different version of bk as a
  subprocess.  We have had cases where users have forgotten to restart
  their bkd's after upgrade BitKeeper and this cases bugs.  BitKeeper
  will now notice this and error until the bkd is restarted.

Environment variables that are used to control BitKeeper's behavior
can not longer be set to an empty string.  So for example:
  BK_NO_TRIGGERS="" bk push
won't work.  Use BK_NO_TRIGGERS=1 instead.
