Release notes for BitKeeper version 7.2-oss

This is the first open source free release of Bitkeeeper. Many changes
involve removing the old licensing code.

Changes:

  Upgraded TclTk to v8.6 which improved appearance on MacOS.

  BitKeeper now uses gfile pathnames in many places where sfile
  pathnames were used in the past. The biggest change is that 'bk -r'
  returns dir/file instead of dir/SCCS/s.file.  Also many error
  messages avoid printing SCCS/s.file pathnames since those are
  confusing.

  Removed old commands:
    bk _eula
    bk lease
    bk legal
    bk more
    bk status --compat
    bk users

  Changed 'bk makepatch' so that it ONLY generates the bk-5.0
  fastpatch format and later. This breaks pull/push compatibility with
  bk-4.x, but old repositories can still be cloned and read.

  Added new traversal options to 'bk changes': --lattice && --longest

  'bk upgrade' was changed to use the downloads.bitkeeper.com website
  directly rather than our separate upgrades.bitkeeper.com site.
  Also the upgrade code is used to get the latest release for 'bk version'.

  Add 'bk describe' command to give a friendly name for the current
  cset like bk-7.1+183@0x56d9f3c0-dirty

Bugs fixed:

  Fixed 'bk citool' support for pre-delta triggers. The old behavior
  was terrible. (sorry)

  'bk changes -R URL' with a bad URL could coredump. Fixed.
