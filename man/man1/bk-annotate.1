.SH NAME
bk annotate \- provide annotated listings of one or more source files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk annotate [\fIoptions\fP] 
.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\*[BK] annotations add an extra level of information, such as date, author,
etc., when viewing file contents.
Annotated listings are useful for deeper understanding of your source
base, i.e., when you are tracking down bugs.  
.LP
\*(BK has two kinds of annotations: annotations of a specific version of a file,
and annotations of all (or some) versions of a file
(the second form is unique to \*(BK).
.LP
By default, the
.B annotate
command will display a specific version of a file with annotations. 
The default version of file is the most recent version; the 
.B \-r
option may be used to specify an alternative version.
The default annotations are the revision in which the change was
made and the user who made that change.  
Selecting any annotations overrides all of the default annotations.
.LP
An alternate form of the
.B annotate
command may be used to show or annotate either all lines added by
all versions or just the lines added by one or more versions (in
the latter case, the whole file is not displayed, instead, only
the lines which were added in that range of changes are
displayed.)
The
.B \-R
option turns on this form of annotate.
Each version of a line is grouped closely with other versions of
that line.
This can be useful for determining when a particular feature was
added or modified.
This form of annotate has no annotations by default, the desired
annotations must be specified.
If no annotations are specified then the selected lines are shown
without annotations.
.SH OPTIONS
.if t .TP .7i
.if n .TP 1.1i
.OPTreq \-A bdnpru
Align annotations in a human readable form.
The set of annotations will be followed by a vertical bar and a space
before the data from each line of the file starts.
Each annotation is aligned in a column.
The option argument[s] turn on one
or more annotations as a prefix to each line.
The possible annotations are:
.RS
.TP
.B b
Prefix each line with the basename of the file.
.tp
.B d
Prefix each line with the date of last modification.
.tp
.B n
Prefix each line with its line number.
.tp
.B p
Prefix each line with pathname of the file relative to the root
of the repository.
.tp
.B r
Prefix each line with the revision of last modification.
.tp
.B u
Prefix each line the name of the user who last modified it.
.RE
.if t .TP .7i
.if n .TP 1.1i
.OPTreq \-a bdnpru
Similar to
.B \-A 
but without the alignment (each annotation is followed by a tab).
.tp
.OPTreq \-c date
annotate the latest version before
.ARG date .
See
.B bk range
for information on specifying dates.
.tp
.B \-k
do not expand RCS or SCCS keywords.
This option is implied by
.B \-R.
.tp
.OPTreq \-r rev
annotate this version of the file.
.tp
.OPTopt \-R rev
annotate the lines added by the specified revision (or range of revisions).
If
.ARG rev
is not specified, that implies all revisions (i.e., 1.0..).
The difference between this option and the previous option
is that in this case
.B "bk annotate"
shows only those lines 
.B added
by the specified revision[s], but in the 
.B \-r
case, the entire contents of the specified version is annotated.
.SH NOTES
The -R form is a replacement for the removed command "sccscat".
