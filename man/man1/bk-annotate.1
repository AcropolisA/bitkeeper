.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Annotated listings are useful for deeper understanding of your source
base, i.e., when you are tracking down bugs.  The annotations add an
extra level of information which can be useful.
.LP
\*(BK has two kinds of annotations:  annotations of a specific version,
and annotations of all (or some) versions (the second form is unique to \*(BK).
.SH ANNOTATE
.LP
The 
.B annotate
command will display a specific version of a file with annotations. 
The default annotations are the revision in which the change was
made and the user who made that change.  Specifying any options
overrides all of the default options.
.SH SCCSCAT
.LP
By default,
.B bk sccscat
will display 
.B all
lines in 
.B all
versions of a file, with each version of a line grouped closely with
other versions of that line.  This is useful for determining when a
particular feature was added.
.LP
.B bk sccscat 
can restrict the set of lines displayed to those lines added in a 
specified revision or date range.  In that case, the whole file is
not displayed, instead, only the lines which were added in that 
range of changes are displayed.  This form is usually a result of
specifying a range to
.BR "bk grep" .
