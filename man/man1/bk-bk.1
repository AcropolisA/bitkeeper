.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bk
is the front end to all \*(BK commands.
All \*(BK commands are prefixed with 
.B bk
in order to avoid ambiguity with
non-\*(BK commands that might be already installed on the system such as 
.B get
and
.BR ci .
.LP
If you are looking for instructions on how to get started, try running the
test drive at
.BR http://www.bitkeeper.com/Test.html .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \*<sfiles_opts\*>
.B \-R
Change directories to the root of the repository before running
.ARG command .
.tp
.OPTopt \-r dir
Starting at 
.ARG dir ,
or the repository root if 
.ARG dir
was not specified, apply
.ARG command
recursively to
.ARG dir
and all subdirectories.
This works by generating a list of sfiles and passing them to
.ARG command
on the standard input.
.tp
.ARG sfiles_opts
One or more options may be used in combination with 
.Q \-r
to limit the set of files passed to
.ARG command .
The following sfiles options may be passed:
.\" HEY!  YOU!  Man page hacker.  If you change these make sure you follow
.\" whatever bk-sfiles.1 says, that's the authoritative source, OK?  Thanks!

.tp
.B \-a
Examine all files, even if listed in
.BR BitKeeper/etc/ignore .
.tp
.B \-c
List changed files (locked and modified).
If
.I clock_skew

List directories under \*(BK control (SCCS subdir exists).
.tp

.tp
.B \-G
List files only if they are checked out ("gotten").
.tp
.B \-i

metadata.
.tp
.B \-l

then list 
leaves which are not in a changeset as 
.Q \-pC
then list leaves which are not in a changeset as 
.B file|1.3
If
.QR \-pA ,
that implies 
.QR \-pC ,
and 
lists all revisions, not just the tip.
If
.BR \-pA ,
that implies 
.BR \-pC ,
and 
lists all revisions, not just the tip.
.Q \-pA
.tp
.B \-u
List unlocked files.
