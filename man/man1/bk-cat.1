.SH NAME
bk cat \- concatenate and display file contents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk cat
.FILES
.SH DESCRIPTION
bk cat is used to send one or more files to standard output.
It is used when a file's contents are wanted but the caller
does not know if the file is or is not under revision control.
.LP
bk cat differs from the standard Unix cat command in two ways:
a) it does not support any of the Unix cat options, and
b) if a file is specified which does not exist, but a
corresponding s.file does exist, the most recent version of
s.file is sent to standard output.
.LP
The following shell script emulates the bk cat command:
.DS
for i in "$@"
do       if [ -f $i ]
         then    cat $i
         else    # ignore error messages
                 bk get -kp $i 2>/dev/null
         fi
 done
