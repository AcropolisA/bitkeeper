.SH NAME
bk collapse \- combine recent changesets into a single unit of work
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk collapse
.[B] \-Lqs
.B \-e
.[OPTreq] \-a rev
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bk collapse
allows you to combine (collapse) the most recent successive changesets made
in a repository.
You typically use this when completing a
develop-review-test-debug-fix cycle to combine a changeset
and all its bug-fix and review-generated changesets into a single
logical unit of work.
In this usage, you specify a revision with
.QR \-a ,
specifying that all changesets since that revision be collapsed.
.LP
.B Note:
Currently, the
.Q \-e
option is required;
the modifications introduced by the changesets to be collapsed 
are applied to the affected files, which are left as locked,
modified files in the repository.
You must subsequently use
.B bk citool
or
.B bk delta/commit
to commit these edits as a single changeset.
.B bk collapse
preserves all checkin comments for individual files and for the collapsed
changesets;
.B bk citool
then uses these saved checkin comments to prepopulate the comments fields
for all affected files and the ChangeSet file.
.LP
You can use
.B bk collapse
without the
.Q \-a
option immediately after a checkin if you realize that
the change was not done or was incorrect.
You can do this \*(lquncommit\*(rq on the most recent changeset
only if you are positive that there are no other copies of this
changeset in other repositories.
.LP
The checkin comments are preserved if you use
.B bk citool
to make the subsequent checkin.
.LP
.B bk collapse
saves a list of the md5keys of all changesets that have been replaced by
the this command in the
.B BitKeeper/etc/collapsed
file.
Later
.B bk pull
examines this file to prevent the uncollapsed csets from being pulled
into the repository with the collapsed versions.
This behavior can be suppressed with the
.B \-L
option.
.LP
.B bk collapse
saves a backup
patch in 
.B BitKeeper/tmp/collapse.patch
in case it turns out that the collapse was the wrong idea.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \*<revsn\*>
.OPTreq \-a rev
Collapse all changesets that occurred after
.ARG rev .
.tp
.B \-e
Leave the resulting changes as locked, modified files; you must run
.B bk citool
or
.B bk delta/commit
to create the final changeset.
.tp
.B \-L
Do not record the csetkeys of the changesets being replaced in
the
.B BitKeeper/etc/collapsed
file.
.tp
.B \-s
when fixing the entire changeset the normal behavior is to save a
backup patch of all the csets being removed in
.B BitKeeper/tmp/collapse.patch
in case something goes wrong.
This option disables this safety net for a minor performance gain.
.tp
.B \-q
suppress most messages
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B bk collapse
returns exit status:
.TP
0
on success.
.tp
1
on failure.
.SH EXAMPLES
Fix a problem is the latest cset.

.DE
.LP
