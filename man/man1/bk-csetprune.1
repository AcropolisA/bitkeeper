.TH "bk csetprune" "\*[BKVER]" %E% "\*(BC" "\*(UM"
.SH NAME
bk csetprune \- shrink a repository by removing files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk csetprune
.[B] \-S
.[OPTreq] \-k 16hexDigits
< keylist
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B csetprune
command is used to prune certain files from the repository.  These files are
removed in a way which is permanent, i.e., the prune cannot be undone.
.LP
The command operates on a list of file keys (sometimes called \*(BK inodes).
Each file associated with a key is 
.B removed
from the repository and from all changesets in the ChangeSet file.  If a 
changeset becomes empty as a result of the key removal,
then that changeset is removed
from the ChangeSet file history.  If a removed changeset had a tag, the 
tag is moved to the closest non-removed ancestor in the ChangeSet file.  
If that ancestor was already tagged with the same tag, the duplicate tag
is discarded.
.LP
After all files have been removed, the identity of the ChangeSet file
is changed (using bk newroot) and the remaining files are ``reparented''
to the new ChangeSet file.
.SH OPTIONS 
.if t .TP .6i
.if n .TP 1i
.B \-S
Keep the symbol structure intact.
This is needed when doing a csetprunes over time on
same key set and wanting the resulting repository to communicate
with a repository created by an earlier csetprune.
Without this option, the internal symbol graph structure is
streamlined.
.tp
.OPTreq \-k 16hexDigits
Specify the
.ARG 16hexDigits
used in a repository root key.
This is needed when doing a csetprunes over time on
same key set and wanting the resulting repository to communicate
with a repository created by an earlier csetprune.
.SH "GENERATING KEYS"
.LP
The
.B prs
command may be used to generate the list of keys.  
When generating keys, it is important to realize that looking in a particular
subdirectory is likely to miss some of the files that you may want to remove.
The files may have been moved to another directory or they may have been 
removed (which is really just a move to the BitKeeper/deleted subdirectory).
.LP
The following command will generate a list of keys for all files originally
created in the ``junk'' subdirectory, including all deleted and/or moved
files:
.DS
bk -r prs -hr+ -nd:ROOTKEY: | grep '|junk/'
.DE
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Suppose there is a repository which has two major subsections, called
``docs'' and ``src'' respectively.  The repository has grown to be too
large and the goal is to split it in two.  The process for doing so would
be to 
.IP (1) 4
Make sure all users have pushed their changes into the main repository.
Changes made after the split will have to exported as a traditional patch
and imported, which loses the checkin comments.
.IP (2)
Clone the repository twice, once for each of ``docs'' and ``src''.
.IP (3)
In each new repository, strip out the files which will be in the other
repository.
.LP
Commands which will do this:
.DS
bk clone master src
bk clone master docs
# Remove the docs files from the src repository
cd src
bk -r prs -hr+ -nd:ROOTKEY: | grep '|docs/' | bk csetprune
# Remove the src files from the docs repository
cd ../docs
bk -r prs -hr+ -nd:ROOTKEY: | grep '|src/' | bk csetprune
