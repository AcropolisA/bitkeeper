changeset, the ChangeSet history, and the differences found
in each file contained in each changeset.

To see the changes for a particular file, click on the file name
in the top left window and you will see:

Use the space bar to move between diffs and files.  Each time you
hit the space bar, the next diff is brought into view.  If you are
on the last diff, the tool moves to the next file. The Next (>>)
buttons and Previous (<<) buttons in the upper-left corner will also
allow you to browse the files and diffs.
