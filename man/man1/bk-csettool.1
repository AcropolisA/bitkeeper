.SH NAME
bk csettool \- \*(BK graphical changeset browser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk csettool [
.OPTreq \-r revs
.Bc ] [
.OPTreq \-f file@rev
.B ] [-]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
csettool is used to view detailed information about the specified
changeset[s].  csettool displays the list of changes in each changeset,
the ChangeSet history, and the differences found in each file contained
in each changeset.
.LP
Csettool is a very useful aide when tracking down bugs. For example,
when using
.B revtool
to view comments for a specific file in order to track when a change
was made to the file. Once the desired file is found, the user can
then click on the "View ChangeSet" button in
.B revtool
to bring up csettool to see what other files were modified at the
same time that the file of interest was modified.
.LP
To see the changes for a particular file, click on the file name
in the top left window and you will see:
.TP 3
\*(BU
the number of diffs in the middle status window
.tp
\*(BU
the old version of the file in the lower-left window
.tp
\*(BU
the new version of the file in the lower-right window
.tp
\*(BU
the ChangeSet's comments followed by the delta's comments in
the upper-right window
.LP
Use the space bar to move between diffs and files.  Each time you
hit the space bar, the next diff is brought into view.  If you are
on the last diff, the tool moves to the next file. The Next (>>)
buttons and Previous (<<) buttons in the top menu bar will also
allow you to browse the files and diffs.
.LP
The
.B History
button in the menu bar can be used to start the graphical history
browser, revtool, on either the entire project (ChangeSet file)
or on the file highlighted in the upper-left window.
