.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To view changes you have made to all of the files in a directory
since checking the files out, type:
.DS
$ bk diffs | more
.DE
To see the changes for all files in your tree, do the following:
.DS
$ bk \-r diffs | more
.DE
The 
.B bk diffs
command supports context, unified, procedural, and side-by-side diffs.
All of the above can be optionally annotated with author, date, and/or
revision numbers.
.LP
You can also diff specific revisions. For example:
.DS
$ bk diffs -r1.2..1.4 foo.c
.DE
.LP
When only one revision is supplied with -r, then that revision is
compared to the working file or the top of trunk if the file is not
edited.
.LP
You can use this to diff your entire tree, including edits against an
existing changeset revision or tag in your repository.
The following forms are available:
.DS
$ bk rset -l<rev> | bk -R diffs -u -
$ bk diffs -C<rev1,rev2> -u
.DE
The two forms are shown because it is sometimes useful to diff a subset,
which may be accomplished by filtering the output of bk rset.
The first form ignores file renames and always outputs diffs relative
to the same s.file.  The second form accounts for renames, i.e.,
the diffs may be from files extracted from different s.files.
.SH OPTIONS
.if t .TP
.if n .TP 1i
.B \-b
Ignore changes in amount of white space.
.tp
.B \-B
Ignore  changes  that  just  insert or delete blank lines.
.tp
.B \-c
Do context diffs.
.tp
.OPTreq \-C rev1,rev2
Diff the changeset 
.ARG rev2
against changeset 
.ARG rev1 .
If
.ARG rev2
is absent,
diff changeset
.ARG rev1
against its parent. If
.ARG rev2
is ".", diff the checked
out files against changeset
.ARG rev1 .
The last form is useful if you want to
capture the checked changes as well the work in progress (modified files).
"bk diffs -Crev1,rev2 -u" is same as "bk export -tpatch -h -du -rrev1,rev2"
