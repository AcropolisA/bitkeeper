.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To view changes you have made to all of the files in a directory
since checking the files out, type:
.DS
$ bk diffs | more
.DE
To see the changes for all files in your tree, do the following:
.DS
$ bk \-r diffs | more
.DE
The 
.B bk diffs
command supports context, unified, procedural, and side-by-side diffs.
All of the above can be optionally annotated with author, date, and/or
revision numbers.
.LP
You can also diff specific revisions. For example:
.DS
$ bk diffs -r1.2..1.4 foo.c
.DE
.LP
When only one revision is supplied with -r, then that revision is
compared to the working file or the top of trunk if the file is not
edited.
.LP
You can use this to diff your entire tree, including edits against an
existing changeset revision or tag in your repository.
The following are equivalent,
the two forms are shown because it is sometimes useful to diff a subset,
which may be accomplished by filtering the output of bk rset.
.DS
$ bk rset -l<rev> | bk -R diffs -u -
$ bk diffs -C<rev> -u
.DE
