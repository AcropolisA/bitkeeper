.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B export
command generates a directory tree alongside the \*(BK
repository which contains checked-out copies of all the files under
\*(BK control.  It can also generate traditional
.RB ( diff
.BR \-urN )
patches between any two revisions of the source tree.
By default, bk export only export user files, files under
the BitKeeper directory are not exported. This behaviour can be
changed with the -i and -x options.
If you are trying the export a patch for a sub-directory, and
some of the file in that directory have been move in/out of the
directory. You want to make sure the out-of-view file look
like deteled file. This is done by replacing the @rev part of 
the out-of-view file to @1.0. You can do this using the following command:
.BR
bk rset -rA,B | your_script | bk gnupatch
