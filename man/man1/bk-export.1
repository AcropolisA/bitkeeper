.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B bk export
command generates a directory tree alongside the \*(BK
repository which contains checked-out copies of all the files under
\*(BK control.  It can also generate traditional
.RB ( diff
.BR \-Nur )
patches between any two revisions of the source tree.
By default,
.B bk export
only exports user files.  Files under
the BitKeeper directory are not exported.  This behavior can be
changed with the 
.Q \-i
and 
.Q \-x
options.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH
INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PROCESSING
.LP
Include and/or exclude patterns may be used to control which
files are exported.
There may be multiple include and/or exclude patterns.
The patterns are a file glob the same as used by 
.BR "bk glob" .
Patterns are matched against the partial pathname from the root
of the repository.
If the partial pathname matches any of the exclude patterns then
the file is skipped.
If there are one or more include patterns but the partial
pathname does not match any of the include patterns then the
file is skipped.
Exclude processing takes precedence over include processing.
.LP
When exporting patches there can be ambiguity as to which name is used 
for include/exclude processing because some files may have been moved 
in the changes implied by the exported patch.
The include/exclude processing always applies to any of file names
contained in the changes implied by the patch.
For example, suppose you have a file that is currently deleted but
at the time of the patch was in
.BR src/foo.c .
If you told the system to export
.B src/*
then the file will be in the set.
