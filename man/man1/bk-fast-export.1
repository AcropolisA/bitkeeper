.SH NAME
bk fast-export \- export the repository in a format compatible with git
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk fast-export
.[B] \-\-no\-bk\-keys
.[OPTreq] \-\-branch= branch
.SH DESCRIPTION
bk fast-export exports the entire repository in a format suitable for
input to git's fast-import command. The output is sent to standard
output.
.LP
By default the BitKeeper MD5KEY of the equivalent changeset will be
added to every commit in git.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-no\-bk\-keys
Don't add the "bk: <mk5key>" line at the end of the comments.
.TP
.OPTreq \-\-branch= branch
By default the export will be done for the "master" branch. This option
lets you do the export for a different branch. This is useful for
exporting two different BitKeeper branches (e.g. "dev" and "stable")
into the same git repository. See CAVEATS below.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
The commands to export a BitKeeper repository named
"bk-repo" to a git repository named "git-repo"
would be:
.DS
$ git init git-repo
$ (cd bk-repo; bk fast-export) | (cd git-repo ; git fast-import)
.DE
.SH CAVEATS
.LP
It's possible to run the exporter over different BitKeeper
repositories and use the same git repository as a destination. All the
shared history will be imported by git only once as long as the
repositories have identical comments and matching gone files. 
.LP
It's probably a good idea to contact BitKeeper support if you are
going to be doing this.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
.B bk fast-export
returns exit status 0 if the export completed successfuly. Non-zero if
there was an error.
