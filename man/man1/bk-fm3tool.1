.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
fm3tool is a three-way merge tool used for resolving differences
between two different versions of a file that have a common ancestor. 
Normally fm3tool is not run from the command line; it is started
during the resolve part of a pull by responding with 'f' at the
merge prompt.
.LP
When fm3tool is started, there are six main areas on the screen.
Notice that information about the local repository is on the left
and remote repository is on the right.

To exit the edit mode, press
<escape> or click on area that divides the merge area from the areas
above it.
