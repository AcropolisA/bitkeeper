.SH NAME
bk fmtool \- \*(BK side-by-side merge tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk fmtool
.ARG local_file
.ARG remote_file
.ARG merged_file
.B bk fmtool
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
fmtool is a side-by-side merge tool used for resolving differences
between two different versions of a file.
.LP
If fmtool is started without arguments, use the Open button to select
the files that you wish to merge.
.LP
When fmtool is started, there are three main windows, the ``local''
window on the left, the ``remote'' window on the right, and the ``merge''
window on the bottom.  When doing a
.B bk resync
or a
.B bk
.BR pull ,
your repository
is considered local and the other one is considered remote, and \*(BK
arranges to have the local version of the file on the left side and the
remote version on the right.
.LP
Merging is done as follows: 
.TP
.B 1.
fmtool starts scanning both files from the top until difference
are found. The identical work (i.e the work up to the point where
the differences are found) is put in the merge window.
.tp
.B 2.
The user selects whether the remote or local version of the change
will be used by clicking the "Use Left" or "Use Right" buttons.
When the user picks a version, the changes are placed in the merge
window.
.tp
.B 3.
Repeat the process until all changes are placed in the merge file.
.LP
The changes in the merge window are colored so that it is easy to tell whether
the work was from the local or remote file.
.LP
Each merge may be undone either by clicking the "Undo" button or using
the keys listed below.  The undo works all the way to the start of
the file.
.LP
If you need to make adjustments to the merge, you can edit the work in 
the merge window.  The merge window is a simple editor - move the mouse
pointer where you want to make the changes and start typing.
