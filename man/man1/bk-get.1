the requested revision.

creation time.

.SH NOTE
You may not need to check out every file in order to compile your
program since most versions of the Make program will check files out
as they are needed.  In order for this to work, the get command needs
to be in your path and the dependencies need to be correct in the
Makefile.  If that is true, a simple \*(lqmake\*(rq will check out and 
build your product.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
.B bk get
returns exit status:
.TP
0
on success.
.tp
1
on failure.
