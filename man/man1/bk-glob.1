.SH NAME
bk glob \- demo program to show glob pattern expansion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk glob
.ARG pattern
.ARG string
.[ARG] "string string .\|.\|."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Some \*(BK interfaces use what are called "glob patterns", sometimes known as
wild cards.
Examples include the configuration file, history listing (\fBbk changes\fP), and
file name expansion (\fBbk files\fR).
.LP
This command may be used to match a glob against one or more strings to see
examples of how the pattern matching works.
.SH WILDCARD MATCHING
A string is a glob pattern if it contains one of the characters
"*",
"?",
"[",
or sometimes
"=".
(The last one, "=", is an alias for "*", to avoid shell quoting in many cases.
See \s-2CONFIGURATION\s0 below.)
The glob pattern is used to match one or more strings (or file names), usually
in a process that takes a glob pattern and a list of possible matches and 
returns the subset of the list which matches the glob pattern.  Matching
works as follows:
.SP
.tp 8
.B ?
Matches any single character (unless "?" is between brackets).
.SP
.tp
.B *
Matches any string (unless "*" is between brackets).
.SP
.tp
.B [...]
A set of characters enclosed in brackets matches a single character if and
only if the character is in the set.
.SP
.tp
.B [^...]
As above but inverts the set.  In other words "[^abc]" matches any character
except "a", "b", or "c".
.SH CONFIGURATION
It is possible to disable all use of globs in file name expansion by setting
the environment variable \f(CBBK_NO_FILE_GLOB\fP to any value.
.LP
Since aliasing "=" for "*" is not a standard feature and it may
cause problems when processing files with "=" as part of their
name, it must be explictly  enabled by setting
\f(CBBK_GLOB_EQUAL\fP to the value of \f(CBYES\fP.
No other value will enable this feature.
.SH EXAMPLES
Test a simple pattern match that matches file.c and file.h:
.DS
bk glob '*.[ch]' file.c file.h file.1
.DE
List all files ending in ".1":
.DS
export BK_GLOB_EQUAL=YES
bk -r files =.1
.DE
See changes in all header files in the current directory:
.DS
bk diffs '*.h'
.DE
See the revision history for all C/header files with the phrase "sccs" in their
name:
.DS
bk sccslog '*sccs*.[ch]'
.DE
See all changesets which include the phrase "BUGID:" followed by a number:
.DS
bk changes '-/BUGID:[123456789]/'
.DE
.SH BUGS
Sets of characters, i.e., [A-Z], have only marginal support.  
Escaping the minus in the set is not supported.
