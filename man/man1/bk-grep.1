.SH NAME
bk grep \- search some/all revisions for a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS

.OPTreq \-c dates
.Bc ] | [
.OPTreq \-r rev
.Bc ] | [
.OPTopt \-R rev
]
.ARG pattern
.BKARGS
.if n .ll 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If you need to find a string which you think may be present in some version
of some file, you can use the 
.B bk grep
command to do that.
.LP
By default,
.B bk grep
searches only the most recent version of each file.
The listing can be annotated with dates,
revision numbers, file names, and/or user names.  
.LP
If no annotations are
selected, the default is to do "\-mn" (revision numbers and file names).
.LP
If a revision is specified with
.BR \-r ,
then 
.B bk get
is used to annotate just that version of the file.
.LP
If a range of revisions are specified with
.BR \-R ,
or a range of dates are specified with
.BR \-c ,
then
.B bk sccscat
is used to get the changes made by that range of revisions.
.B Note:
just the additions made by the selected versions are annotated in this case.
.LP
The output found is passed through the native
.BR grep (1)
command.
.SH OPTIONS
.if n .TP 1i
.if t .TP .7i
.B \-a
Suppress all annotations.
.tp
.OPTreq \-c dates
Specify the versions as a range of dates.
.tp
.B \-d
Prefix each line with the date it was last modified.
.tp
.B \-e
Use 
.B egrep
instead of
.BR grep .
.tp
.B \-i
Ignore the case of letters in making comparisons (passed through to
.BR grep (1)).
.tp
.B \-m
Prefix each line with the rev it was last modified in.
.tp
.B \-n
Prefix each line with the filename.
.tp
.B \-N
Prefix each line with the line number.
.tp
.OPTreq \-r rev
Only look in revision
.ARG rev
for the pattern.  
.tp
.OPTopt \-R rev
Only look in range of revisions
.ARG rev
for the pattern.  If
.ARG rev
is not specified, that implies all versions of the file[s].
The difference between this option and the previous option
is that in this case
.B "bk grep"
looks in the lines 
.B added
by the specified revision, but in the 
.B \-r
case, the entire contents of the specified version is searched.
.tp
.B \-u
Prefix each line with the user who last modified it.
.SH EXAMPLES
To see if 
.ARG pattern
occurs anywhere in any version of any file of your tree:
.DS
$ bk -r grep -R pattern
.DE
To see if it occurs anywhere
in the most recent version of of any file of your tree:
.DS
$ bk -r grep pattern
.DE
To see if it was added by the most recent delta
made in of any file of your tree:
.DS
$ bk -r grep -R+ pattern
.DE
.SH BUGS
The ways of specifying which versions to search are non-obvious.  You
need to read the examples carefully.  We made the default be the most
useful/common one.
.LP
There really ought to be a way to grep changes made by a changeset
or range of changesets.
.LP
When looking through annotated files, the if the annotation contains
the string but the line data does not, it still matches.  In other
words, if you look for "foo" and you have a file named "foobar", all
lines in that file will be printed.
