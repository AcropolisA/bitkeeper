.B bk has [\-ar]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command takes a changeset revision and lists all changesets which 
contain the specified changeset.  It is typically used to see if a bug
fix is in a particular release.  If the changeset has been excluded from
a later changeset, the later changeset and its' descendents will not be
listed.
.LP
By default, the listing is restricted to tagged changesets since those
are more likely to correspond to a release.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B \-a
show all which contain the specified changeset.
.tp
.B \-r
List revisions before the symbolic tags, if any.  Some tags occur on multiple
changesets, this option removes the ambiguity.
