.SH NAME
bk helptool \- graphical front-end to the help system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk helptool
.BI [ topic ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The helptool command is a graphical interface to the online help system.
.LP
There are two text windows displayed, a window of topics on the left
and the help text on the right.  There are multiple sections, which
group related topics together.  A topic is slightly indented, the
section heading is not.
.LP
You can move around using the mouse, clicking on topics.  You can
also page through the entire help using PageDown or PageUp.  To move
from section to section, use the Left arrow to move up and the Right
arrow to move forward.  This is fairly useful since the first entry
in each section tries to give a brief overview of that section.
.SH "HYPERLINK STACK"
.LP
Helptool has a stack of places that you have visited, very similar
to  the hyperlink stack in Netscape.  If you click on a topic you will
notice that the "Back" button becomes enabled.  Clicking it will move
back to the previous topic.  Similarly for forward.  The same hot keys
which work in Netscape are used here for forward and back.
.SH SEARCHING
.LP
Helptool includes a simple search facility.  To search for information,
you type a word or phrase and hit return (or click on Search).  The search
facility is fairly basic, single word searches tend to work better
than phrases.  If a phrase is wanted, it must be put in quotes, i.e.,
"lock file".
.LP
The lines which match, if any, are shown slightly indented.  Above the
indent lines is the name of the command or help page which contains
the lines.  You can click on that to jump to that page.  Each command
or page which contains the search phrase will be be highlighted in orange
so that you click through each of the pages which contain the information.
.LP
If you go to a page and it was not what you wanted, and you wish
to look at the summary lines again, jump back by clicking Search or
hitting return.
.SH BINDINGS
.LP
The up/down bindings will move through topics, so when they hit the end
and the key is pressed again, the topic changes to the next or previous.
