.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR "bk here" ,
.BR "bk populate" ,
and
.B "bk unpopulate"
commands are used to manage the set of populated aliases and/or components
in a nested collection.
.LP
The initial set of populated aliases are determined when a nested
collection is cloned.  If no aliases are specified on the clone
command line then the set is specified via the
.I clone_default
configuration variable (which is "ALL" if not found).
If one or more aliases are
specified, then only the repositories implied by those aliases 
are populated.
.LP
The 
.B "bk here"
command can be used to list what is here, set what is here, or
check what is here or list where missing components are.
The 
.B "bk populate"
command can be used to add to what is here.
The 
.B "bk unpopulate"
command can be used to remove from what is here.
.LP
In order to preserve any local work, before removing any components
.B "bk here"
needs to be able to verify everything being removed exists elsewhere.
The
.B "bk superset"
command will be run, which searches for local changesets, deltas,
modifications, extra files, etc.
See
.B -f
below for how to skip this check.
.LP
Note that it is not (currently) possible to remove part of an alias.
If DEVTOOLS is populated and it implies "cmd/gcc" and "cmd/gdb",
attempting to remove either component will result in an error.
See examples below for how to work around this.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \-\@\ URL\ 
.OPTreq \-@ URL
When looking for components, include 
.ARG URL
in the list of places to look.
.\" also  -@@filename   (but ok not to document)
.tp
.B \-f
When removing repositories, do not check for local only work
in the repositories to be removed.
Using this option when there is local only work is dangerous
unless you plan to undo all of that work.
.tp
.B \-q
Run quietly.
.tp
.B \-v
When listing aliases, show alias expansions using an indented list.
Add
.B \-v
more options to indent to a deeper level.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
When cloning a product, it is possible to clone a subset of it by
specifying one or more component names or aliases.
That will clone just that subset:
.DS
$ bk clone -sDEVTOOLS bk://server/big-product
$ cd big-product
$ bk here
DEVTOOLS
PRODUCT
.DE
Note that the list of what is "here" takes two forms, how you specified
it (typically one or more aliases), and the set of components implied
by those aliases.
To get the second form:
.DS
$ bk comps -h
\&./cmd/gcc
\&./cmd/gas
\&./cmd/ld
.DE
If you need to add something, you just tell 
.B "bk populate" 
to do that:
.DS
$ bk populate DEBUGGER
$ bk here
DEBUGGER
DEVTOOLS
PRODUCT
.DE
If you need to remove something, you can only remove what you added, not
individual components:
.DS
$ bk unpopulate ./cmd/gcc
unpopulate: ./cmd/gcc is part of the DEVTOOLS alias, not removing.
.DE
If you absolutely must remove a subset, you can do so by exploding the
alias in question into components:
.DS
$ bk here | grep -v DEVTOOLS > tmp
$ bk alias DEVTOOLS >> tmp
$ bk here set - < tmp
$ bk unpopulate ./cmd/gcc
$ bk here
\&./cmd/gas
\&./cmd/ld
DEBUGGER
PRODUCT
.DE

.SH AVAILABILITY
This command is an optional feature of \*[BK]
and must be enabled in your license.
To see if your license has this enabled, run
.DS
bk lease renew
bk lease show
.DE
If the options field has "SAM" listed then your
license has this feature enabled.
If not, contact BitMover sales.
