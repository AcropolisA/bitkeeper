.SH NAME
bk ignore \- ignore shell glob patterns
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk ignore 
.ARG glob
.[ARG] glob " .\|.\|."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The 
.B ignore
command is used to tell \*(BK about files which should
be ignored when looking for extras files not under revision control.
It affects the output of 
.B bk sfiles \-x
and all commands which use that output, such as 
.B bk citool
and 
.B bk
.BR extras .
.LP
Typical things to ignore are object files, core files, a.out, *.exe, etc.
.LP
The patterns that do not contain a slash are matched against the
basename of the file and patterns with a slash are matched against the
pathname of the file relative to the root of the repository.  A './'
can be added to the start of a pattern to force it to match in the
repository root.
.LP
If you are trying to never have the file
.ARG JUNK
match, regardless of which directory it is in, you can say
.DS
bk ignore JUNK
.DE
and that will match 
.B JUNK
and
.B sub/dir/JUNK
but not
.BR JUNK-PRECIOUS .
.LP
If you want to match a file in just one subdirectory, you can do
.DS
bk ignore sub/directory/this_one
.DE
which will match 
.B sub/directory/this_one
but not
.BR other_dir/this_one .
.LP
If you want to ignore just the JUNK file at the root of the
repository, you can do
.DS
bk ignore ./JUNK
.DE
which will match
.B JUNK
but not
.BR sub/dir/JUNK .
.LP
If you give ignore no arguments it will print out the current ignore list.
.LP
The ignore list is saved in the file
.BR BitKeeper/etc/ignore .
You may edit this file if you wish; the format is simply one glob per line.
Editing the ignore file is the only way to remove entries from the list.
.LP
The
.B BitKeeper/etc/ignore
file can also be used to prune certain subdirectories of your
repository.
By adding a line with the path to a directory from the root of the
repository followed by " -prune" no BitKeeper operations will descend
into that directory.
Pruning large non-revision controlled directory trees that appear in
your repository can significantly improve performance in some cases.
The -prune feature only matches the entire directory path from the root
of the repository and may not contain globs.
.LP
The default ignore list is
.DS
PENDING -prune
BitKeeper/log -prune
BitKeeper/tmp -prune
BitKeeper/writer -prune
BitKeeper/readers -prune
BitKeeper/etc/level
BitKeeper/etc/csets-in
BitKeeper/etc/csets-out
