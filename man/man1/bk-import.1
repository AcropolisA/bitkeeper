.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Use bk import to put plain text files, patches (diff -Nur),
patches and comments in the form of email messages, SCCS files, and 
RCS/CVS files (in this document RCS will mean CVS, MKS and RCS)
into a \*(BK package.  For file (text, SCCS, RCS, etc) imports,
bk import does its work outside of your original tree
thus leaving the original files intact while importing them into a 
\*(BK package.
.LP
Patch and email imports are the only type of import which may be done
repeatedly in the same destination package.
.LP
See below for information specific types of imports.
.\"You can import files by specifying the directory
.\"containing files for import (Note: All files under the directory will
.\"be imported.  If a subset is desired, specify using a list or run 
.\"interactively.)
.\".DS
.\"bk import /path/to/src_files /path/to/package
.\".DE
.\".LP
.\"You may also specify files to import using an external list.  The
.\"path names of files in the list must be relative to the source directory.
.\".DS
.\"bk import -l/tmp/list ~/src/files ~/package
.\".DE
.\"bk import can be run interactively to include and exclude files using
.\"regular expressions.
.\".DS
.\"bk import -i ~/src_files ~/package
.\"End patterns with "." by itself or EOF
.\"Include>> *.c
.\"Include>> *.h
.\"Include>> Makefile
.\"Include>> .
.\".DE
.\"To import from a CVS tree:
.\".DS
.\"bk import -v -tCVS warehouse new
.\".DE
.SH OPTIONS
.if t .TP
.if n .TP 1i
.B \-C
Do not commit the ChangeSet.
.tp
.B \-f
Force; do not prompt for list editing.
.tp
.B \-F
Fast; run more quickly for large imports.
.B NOTICE:
use this option 
.B only
when you know that this is the only \*(BK activity you are doing. 
Using this option on two parallel imports may cause \*(BK consistency
problems.
.tp
.OPTreq \-g gap
Change or disable the gap used to cluster changeset grouping.  A gap
of 0 clusters all changes into one big changeset; a gap of non-zero
clusters changes which happen less than that timespan apart.
The value is in minutes with the default set to 10.
.tp
.OPTreq \-H hostname
Set the hostname used for the creation of any new deltas during the import.
.tp
.B \-i
Prompts for a regular expression to apply to the list of files.
All matches are included. (For use with all types except patches.)
.tp
.OPTreq \-l file
Use the list of files in 
.ARG file .
(For use with all types except patches.)
.tp
.B \-q
Be quiet.
.tp
.OPTreq \-S sym
Add tag 
.ARG sym
to the changeset created around the import
.tp
.OPTreq \-t type
Specify import file type.  
.ARG type
can be one of:
.if t .RS .5i
.if n .RS .3i
.tp
.B plain
Import plain text files
.tp
.B patch
Import a patch (diffs)
.tp
.B RCS
Import RCS files
.tp
.B CVS
Import CVS files. The only difference from -tRCS is that Attic directories
are processed and deleted files are detected.
All RCS options may be used with CVS imports.
.tp
.B MKS
Import MKS Source Integrity files.  The files are stripped of the 
.I ext
field, moved from 
.I rcs
directories to
.I RCS
directories,
a
.I ,v
suffix is added and then the normal RCS processing is applied.
All RCS options may be used with MKS imports.
.tp
.B SCCS
Import SCCS files
.RE
.tp
.B \-v
Be verbose.
.tp
.B \-x
Prompts for a regular expression to apply to the list
of files.  All matches are excluded.  (For use with all types except patches.)
.SH "RCS OPTIONS"
.if t .TP
.if n .TP .8i
.B \-h 
turn off verification of contents (faster, unsafe).
.tp
.B \-T
Do not import tags. The default is to import tags.
.tp
.B \-u
Run files through bk undos first; this will convert
DOS style end of lines to Unix style end of lines.
.SH "PATCH OPTIONS"
.if t .TP
.if n .TP .4i
.tp
.OPTreq \-p num
Strip  the  smallest prefix containing
.ARG num
leading slashes from each file name found in the patch file.
.tp
.B \-r
Do not do rename processing when doing patch imports.
.tp
.B \-R
If a patch fails to apply cleanly, back out the entire operation
and exit with a failure.
.tp
.OPTreq \-y comment
Set the message for the delta comments for all files to
.B <comment>
rather than "Import patch PATCHNAME".
.tp
.OPTreq \-z fuzz
Control the acceptance of fuzz by
.B bk patch
by passing the argument
.B \-F
.ARG fuzz
to
.B patch
rather than the default
.B \-F0
, which indicates strict matching.  See the
.B bk help patch
manpage for further information. 
.SH "IMPORTING PATCHES"
.LP
\*(BK can be used to track external work by importing patches (diff -Nur)
into a \*(BK package.  \*(BK can help with downsides of patches, namely that
renames are not tracked well and that there generally aren't very good comments 
if any at all attached to the changes being made.
.\" XXX - I don't know
.\" if the above is a completely true and pertinent statement.
A rename in a patch is viewed as the deletion of one file and the
creation of another file, so to track these, bk import will launch 
bk renametool which is the graphical tool used to manually 
match the deleted files with the newly created files.
.SH "IMPORTING EMAILS"
.LP
\*(BK can import patches contained in email messages.  This style of import
is an additional layer over the normal patch import.  The usage for this
version of bk import is
.DS
bk import -temail repo < mailbox
.DE
where 
.I mailbox
may contain multiple messages, each containing a patch.  The user and
hostname are taken from the email header
and the subject line 
is used as the checkin comment for each file, as well as the first
line of the changeset comment.  If there is any preamble above the patch,
that is used as the rest of the changeset comments.  Note that importing 
an email patch records the name of the importer as well as the name of
author (which is derived from the email).  The importer name is available
via the :IMPORTER: key word, see bk help prs for more information.
.LP
This part of import makes use of code copyrighted by Linus Torvalds
and is used with permission.
.SH "IMPORTING RCS (AND CVS OR MKS) FILES"
.LP
The default branch of the RCS tree is the one that will be imported.
No other branches are imported, branch imports are on a consulting basis
only.
All metadata, such as dates, times, user names, checkin comments, and
symbolic tags are preserved on import.
.LP
This type of import requires RCS 5.6 or later to be installed on the importing
system.
.SH "IMPORTING PLAIN TEXT"
.LP
Importing a plain text file into a \*(BK package can only be done once.
If there is already a file in the package that has the same name as a
file to be imported the import will fail.  
.LP
If a package is already
populated with files use the -i, -x or -l options 
to avoid trying to import files already in the package.  Because of the
preceding constraints, import does not catch renames with plain text files.
If a file has been renamed, it can be imported, but the original file will
still exist in the package so it is necessary to remove the original file
from the package tree after the import of the renamed file.
.LP
Plain text files can be imported from a directory, 
.DS
bk import /path/to/src_files ~/package
.DE
from a list of files relative to the source directory, 
.DS
bk import -l/tmp/list /path/to/src_files ~/package
.DE
or by using regular expressions in interactive mode
.DS
bk import -ix ~/src_files ~/package
End patterns with . by itself or EOF
File name pattern to include>> *.c
File name pattern to include>> *.h
File name pattern to include>> Makefile
File name pattern to include>> .
End patterns with . by itself or EOF
File name pattern to exclude>> *.o
File name pattern to exclude>> .
.DE
.SH "IMPORTING SCCS FILES"
.LP
Teamware and other SCCS files can be imported.  The history of the file is
preserved, but the unmerged branches are discarded.  This is okay because 
the necessary metadata is in the mainline.  
.LP
Importing \*(BK files is not supported; use bk clone.
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.LP
Import does not handle errors in a robust way.  If unsuccessful, import
may leave work half done in the destination package.  It is suggested that
the import destination repository is a clone of the original package in case of
a failed import.
