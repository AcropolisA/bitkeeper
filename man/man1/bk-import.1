.OPTreq \-l file
.Bc ] [
.OPTreq \-S sym

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If you have not yet set up a package, read the bk help setup section.
.LP
If you have a tree full of files which you wish to include, go to
your tree and make sure there is nothing in it except for the files
you want to place under revision control (or see the section on file
specification below).  Then do this:
.DS
$ bk import /path/to/src_files /path/to/package
.DE
This will copy all files *below* /path/to/src_files into the
package directory and check in the initial revision of the files.
Your original files are left untouched.
.SH "FILE SPECIFICATION"
.LP
You can generate the list of files externally, and pass that list
to import.  In that case, the usage is
.DS
$ bk import -l/tmp/list ~/src/files ~/package
.DE
and the list of files must be relative paths, relative to the root
of the "from" directory.  One way to generate the list might be:
.DS
$ cd ~/src/files
$ find . -type f -name '*.[ch]' -print > /tmp/list
$ bk import -l/tmp/list ~/src/files ~/package
.DE
If you want to filter the lists, you can do that as well. One way would
is to edit the /tmp/list file with a text editor.  Another way is to
use bk's interactive mode of setting file inclusions and exclusions.
Suppose that you have a tree which has other stuff in it, such as .o's
or core files, whatever.  You happen to know that the files you want
are all of the form *.c *.h or Makefile and you want to pick up just
these files.  To do that, try the -include and/or -exclude options
and enter the patterns one per line:
.DS
$ bk import -i ~/src_files ~/package
End patterns with "." by itself or EOF
Include>> *.c
Include>> *.h
Include>> Makefile
Include>> .
.DE
Importing from a CVS tree:
.DS
$ bk import -v -tCVS warehouse new
.DE
