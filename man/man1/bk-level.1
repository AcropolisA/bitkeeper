.SH NAME
bk level \- set or show the level of the repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk level [
.ARG num ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The level command prints or sets the level of the repository.  A repository
with no level setting defaults to level 1.  
The level is automatically set when a repository is cloned to the level of
the parent repository.
.LP
With an argument, it sets the level to that argument.  
With no argument, the command prints the repository level.
If an error occurs, the level is shown as 1 million (1000000).
.LP
Repository levels may be used to control the flow of changesets.  Changes
may only flow to a repository of the same or higher level.  The typical
use for levels is to create a stable or bugfix repository.  If that repository
has a lower level than the development repository, changes may be moved from
stable to development, but not the other way.
