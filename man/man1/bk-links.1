.TH "bk links" "\*[BKVER]" %E% "\*(BC" "\*(UM"
.SH NAME
bk links \- make links to the \*(BK binary installation directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\"
.B bk links
.ARG public_dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates symbolic links from \*(BK commands in the specified public
directory to the executables for the version of \*(BK being run.
This is typically used after installing \*(BK as a non-root user.
.LP
The purpose of the symbolic links is to provide compatible interfaces for
those tools which understand the \*[ATT] system.  \*[BK] deliberately 
chooses to look like \*[SC] so that programs such as make(1), patch(1),
emacs(1), and others will automatically work with \*[BK] the same way
they worked with \*[SC].  \*[BK] is not an \*[SC] based system, it 
just appears as such on the command line for compatibility with existing
applications.
