.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B bk log
command is used to extract revision history and or metadata from a file or
set of files.  The default behavior is to print a summary of each revision
to each of the specified files.  There are options to restrict the set of
revisions to print, a very commonly used one is
.BR \-r+ ,
which restricts the set to the most recent revision.
.LP
With no options 
.B bk log
output defaults to giving information on all revisions
of all files in the present directory that are under \*(BK control.  
Output is given as follows: the name of the file and range of revisions
is followed by a detailed account of each revision.  Revision number, 
revision date and time, user who made that revision, what the relative
path from root of repository is to that file, the comments that go
with that revision, and documents if the file has been renamed.
.SH OPTIONS

.SS RANGE SPECIFICATIONS
.TP \fB\-c9207..92\fP
.B \-r+
prints the most recent delta
.tp
.B \-r1.3..1.6

.tp
.B \-c9207..92
prints all deltas from July 1 '92 to Dec 31 '92
.tp
.B \-c92..92
prints all deltas from Jan 1 '92 to Dec 31 '92
.tp
.B \-c\-1d
prints all deltas made in the last 24 hours; similarly for
.IR s ,
.IR m ,
.IR h ,
.IR d ,
.IR M ,
and
.IR Y 
for seconds,minutes, hours, days, months, and years.
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
.LP
The 
.B bk log
command has a default output format which can be overridden.  There are
many different pieces of information in a \*(BK file and 
.B bk log 
can extract most of them.
To extract specific information, a \*(lqdspec\*(rq
(data specification) string must be provided and should contain
keywords surrounded by colons.
.B bk\ log
will expand each of these keywords in the output it produces.
To specify a 
.SM TAB
character in the output, use
.BR \et ;
to specify a 
.SM NEWLINE
in the output,
use 
.BR \en .
An example dspec 
which prints the \*(BK file name and the revision number
is 
.BR ':SFILE:\ :REV:\en' .
.LP
In almost all cases, a trailing
newline is not provided by any of the variables 
and one should be provided as needed.
The list of variables which currently provide one are:
.V COMMENTS ,
.V PRS ,
.V PATH ,
and
.V TAGS .
.LP
Multi-line variables are printed with no spacing or newlines between the
lines by default.  You may insert spaces or newlines with a 
.B $each(\|) 
loop like so
.DS
bk log -d'$each(:C:){(:C:)\en}' foo.c
.DE
In this
.B $each(\|)
construction, (\c
.V :C: )
iteratively takes the value of each line of the multi-line value of
.V :C: .
For example, to prefix each comment line with ">> " the dspec would
be:
.DS
bk log -d'$each(:C:){>> (:C:)\en}' foo.c
.DE
.LP
The list of variables with this behavior is:
.V C ,
.V FD ,
and
.V TAG .
.br
.ne 5
.SS CONDITIONAL OUTPUT
The 
.I dspec
can produce output conditionally.  The following will print the default
output format for each revision made by 
.IR lm :
.DS
bk log -d'$if(:P:=lm){:PRS:}' foo.c
.DE
.br
.ne 5
.SS CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
.TP \fB\-c9207..92\fP
.if t \fB$if(\fIexpr\fB)\fB{\fIanything\fB}\fR
.\" XXX needs to be conditional on helpdoc?
.if n \fB$if(\fI<expr>\fB)\fB{\fI<anything>\fB}\fR
prints 
.ARG anything
if
.ARG expr
is true.  If
.ARG expr 
is a field, i.e.,
.V :MERGE: ,
then the field is examined and returns true if it has a value.
.ARG anything 
can contain fields as normal, i.e.,
.V :REV: .
.tp
.if t \fB$unless(\fIexpr\fB)\fB{\fIanything\fB}\fR
.\" XXX needs to be conditional on helpdoc?
.if n \fB$unless(\fI<expr>\fB)\fB{\fI<anything>\fB}\fR
prints 
.ARG anything
if
.ARG expr
is false.

.SS ITERATIVE OUTPUT
.ad b
Some fields, such as comments or tags, may be multi-line.  To print a prefix
in front of each of these lines, the idiom is:
.DS
bk log -d'$if(:C:){$each(:C:){C\ \ (:C:)\en}}' foo.c
.DE
The variables that support this kind of iteration are
.V C ,
.V FD ,
and
.V TAG .
The
.V GB
variable may not be used in a 
.BR $each(\|) .
.SS KEYWORDS
Some fields are per file and are marked with
.B F
in the 
.B T
column below; other fields are per delta and are marked with
.BR D .
In the ``What is printed'' column, 
.B D
refers to the specified delta, since some operations work relative to 
.BR D .
Some fields are compatible with \*[ATT], they are typically the one and 
two letter fields;  \*[BK] fields tend to be longer.
