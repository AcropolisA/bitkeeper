.SH NAME
bk merging \- help on merging conflicts
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This section documents the merge process started by the resolve command.
See 
.B bk resolve
for details on using resolve.
.LP
While in resolve, you can hit the return key to see a summary of
the commands.
.LP
The 
.B bk resolve
command prompts you on each file that has conflicts.
A conflict is defined as two deltas made in parallel in different
repositories.  If the conflict does not have any overlapping lines,
then it may have been automerged, depending if
.B bk resolve
was run with the 
.B -a
option.
.LP
There are other sorts of conflicts, besides the usual file content
conflicts.  \*(BK manages file names, permissions, flags, symbols,
and descriptive text in the same way as it manages file contents.
That means that you can have a permissions conflict if, for example, one
person changed the file to 0755 mode and another changed it to 0777 mode.
.LP
The resolve process for all conflicts is fairly similar.  For each
type of conflict on each file, you will be prompted for an action.
To view a brief summary of the conflict and a list of available
actions, hit return (or "?" or "help").  The choices usually include
a more detailed explanation of the situation; we try to consistently
make this available as the "x" command (as in eXplain).
.LP
Some of the available actions allow you to diff the files, view
file history, and merge using graphical tools, etc.  See the command
summary for the full list.
.SH "VIEW DIFFERENCES AND HISTORY"
.LP
To see the diffs use the "d" command.  For side-by-side diffs, use the
"sd" command.  You can also diff one or the other branches against the
common ancestor using "dr" or "dl".  Type "D" to get a graphical, color
coded side-by-side diff browser.
.LP
There are also built-in commands to show the history of the file (see
"h", "hl", "hr").  In addition, "p" starts the the graphical file
browser which allows you to view the difference between versions by
clicking the left button on the earlier rev and the right button on
a later rev.  The bottom of the screen will show the diffs.  If you
type Return at the prompt, the three revisions forming the merge are
part of the help message.

.SH "MERGING CONTENTS"
.LP
When in resolve, there are four different files for each merge.  They
are:
.TP
.B local
The version of the file in the local repository.
.tp
.B remote
The version of the file in the other repository.
.tp
.B merge
The merged file.
.tp
.B GCA
A common ancestor of the local/remote versions.
.LP
Your goal is to generate the merge file using one of the methods below.
.LP
The easiest and most popular merge method is to use the "m" command
for cases where there are no overlapping lines. This method performs
a three-way diff and merge and warns you when there are overlapping
lines.  If there are overlaps, you have to edit the merged file (use
the "e" command), find the conflict markers which look like "<<<<"
or ">>>>", and manually fix the conflicts.  This command requires
care since non-overlapping lines does not mean that the merge makes
semantic sense.
.LP
If the merge looks complicated, a good approach is to start up the
file browser with "p" and then start up a side-by-side filemerge with
"f".  Then walk through the diffs, picking and choosing with blocks
of code to use.  If you get confused about who added what, you can go
to the history tool browser (revtool) and left click on the common
ancestor and right click on each of the two tips of the trunk/branch
to see who added what.
.LP
It is also possible to use a combination of graphical tools and the
automatic merge.  You can type "p" to run the file browser, "D" to run
difftool, "m" to do the merge, and then "e" to edit the merged file.
The file browser is run in so you can look at the various changes as
described above.  Warning: if you are running your editor and the
file merge program, then both are working on the same output file
and whichever one writes it last, overwrites any earlier versions.
.LP
You may also call an external tool to merge changes.  When in the resolver,
if you say
.DS
file.c>>\ \c
.Bc !
.ARG command
.DE
.ft R
then
.ARG command
will be run with the following environment variables set:
.br
.ne 5
.TP 1i
BK_LOCAL
pathname of a temp file containing the local version
.tp
BK_GCA
file containing the common ancestor
.tp
BK_REMOTE
pathname of a temp file containing the remote version
.tp
BK_MERGE
pathname where the merged content should be placed
.SH COMMIT
.LP
The merge process is not complete until you commit the file with the
"C" command at the resolve prompt.  This means you can merge repeatedly
until you are happy with the results.  Each time you merge and save,
however, you overwrite the previous merge attempt.
.LP
When you are happy with your merged file, click done in filemerge,
exit the file browser, and type "C" at the prompt to commit
the file and move on to the next one.
