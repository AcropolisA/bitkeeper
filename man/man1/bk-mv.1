.SH NAME 
bk mv \- move file[s]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.if t \{\
.B bk mv
.I source destination
\}
.if n
bk mv <source> <destination>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To move a file from
.I A
to
.I B
do this:
.AX
$ bk mv A B
.XA
The
.B mv
command will move the checked out file (if any) as well as the
revision control file.  Edited files (i.e. ones that are read-write and
locked) can not be moved; you must check them in first.  The rename
will appear as a separate change to the file when you commit the
next changeset.
.LP
Renames happen automatically when you
.B bk resync.
The 
.B bk resolve
command
will ask for help if both repositories renamed the same file
differently.
.SH NOTES
.LP
.B bk mv
will not move directories.
