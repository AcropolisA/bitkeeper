.SH NAME 
bk obscure \- obscure \*(BK file comments and contents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk obscure --I-know-this-destroys-my-tree
.SH NOTICE
This command will destroy your repository, do it if and only if the repository
in question is an unneeded copy.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The obscure command is typically used if you wish to send someone a repository
for performance analysis and/or debugging.
All data files have their contents and comments
obscured.  The intent is that the obscuring of the repository data will
result in a repository which has the same size, shape, number of deltas,
number of changesets, etc., but with different data.
.LP
The current method used to obscure the data is to sort each line of data
alphabetically, i.e.,
.DS
Please obscure me
.DE
turns into
.DS
ussromleeeecbaP
.DE
The obscuring is currently fairly simple and is theoretically
reversible with enough compute power so this is not a means to encrypt
a repository.  All commercial customers of BitMover are covered by an 
non-disclosure clause in their commercial contract; the
combination of that clause and the obfuscation are
a reasonable way to provide BitMover access to a repository.
