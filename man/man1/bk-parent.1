.SH NAME
bk parent \- show or set the parent repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk [\-qr] parent [
.ARGc repository
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The parent command prints or sets the default location where the 
\fBbk pull\fR/\fBbk push\fR commands get/put new work.
.LP
With no argument, the comand prints the parent name.  With an argument, it sets
the parent to that argument.  
.LP
The parent is automatically set when a repository is cloned.
.SH REPOSITORY NAMES
\*(BK supports multiple ways to access a repository.  The selection of the
access method is determined by how the repository is referenced.  Each
form is described here:
.SS LOCAL NAME
.in +4
.de head
.	br
.	ne 4
.	ti -4
..
.head
.ARG pathname
.br
access is all local, through the local file system.
.head
.ARGc host :
.ARG pathname
.br
Normally a remote repository unless 
.ARG host 
is what
.B bk host
returns or is
.BR localhost .
In either of those cases, this form is the same as the above form.
.SS REMOTE NAME
.in +4
.head
.ARGc host :
.ARG pathname
.br
Uses 
.B ssh 
(by default)
to access 
.ARG host ,
and starts a temporary
.BR bkd .
If 
.B $BK_RSH 
is set, then use that to talk to the host (allows proxying).
If no 
.B ssh
is not found, then falls back to
.BR rsh.
.head
\fBbk\fR://\c
.ARG host
.br
Connects to an existing 
.B bkd
on the default 
.B bkd
port.
The 
.B bkd
most be at the root of the repository.
.head
\fBbk\fR://\c
.ARGc host /
.ARG pathname
.br
Connects to an existing 
.B bkd
on the default bkd port,
changes to 
.ARG <pathname> ,

.br
Connects to
.ARG host
using 
.BR ssh ,
assumes that 
.B bkd
