.\" .SH BUGS
.\" .LP
.\" If the repository has parked files and those files are modified by 
.\" bk pull when bk unpark is run, it may fail with the following error:
.\" .DS
.\" Unparking BitKeeper/tmp/parkfile-1
.\" patching file UserGuide
.\" Hunk #12 FAILED at 716.
.\" 1 out of 12 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file UserGuide.rej

.\" .BU Check that the park file still exists
.\" .BU Clean the directory with the problem file
.\" .BU Undo the pull
.\" .BU Unpark
.\" .DS
.\" ls /BitKeeper/tmp	# look for parkfile-NUM
.\" mv problem_file problem_file.tmp
.\" bk clean
.\" bk unlock problem_file
.\" bk -r check -ac
.\" bk status		# make sure no new changes have been made
.\" bk unpull
.\" bk unpark
