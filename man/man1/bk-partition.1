.SH NAME
bk partition \- transform a single repository into a nested collection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk partition
.[B] \-q
.[OPTreq] \-j N
.[OPTreq] \-C components
.[OPTreq] \-G gonelist
.ARG from
.ARG to
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B partition
command is used to transform a single large repository to product
composed of a collection of component repositories.
The collection of component files is determined by the map file,
which is a list of directories which will become component repository
roots.
.LP
Before the transform, it is possible to remove the record of some files
that were accidentally added along the way, and or have since been
removed and added to the gone file.
A list of keys to be removed is stored in a gonelist file, one key per
line.
.LP
The resulting repository will not be able to communicate with the
original repository.
This command can be run with the same 
.ARG components
and
.ARG gonelist
over any repository that could communicate with the original repository
and the result can communicate with the result of the original partition.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP \-C\*<components\*>
.OPTreq \-C components
Specify a file containing the directories that will become
component repository roots.
The directories are listed in the file, one per line.
Lines starting with # will be ignored, as well as blank lines.
.tp
.OPTreq \-G gonelist
Specify a file containing the keys to be removed before the partitioning
begins.
This is similar to running a bk csetprune before running bk partition.
The difference is that the bk partition command will provide the stable
-k parameter to the csetprune enable the resulting repositories to
communicate with repositories that have gone through the same partitioning.
.tp
.OPTreq \-j N
Run the per-component portions of the partition in parallel using N
processes.  Useful for partitioning on multi-core machines.
.tp
.B \-q
Run quietly.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Suppose there is a repository which has two major subsections, called
.B doc
and
.B src
respectively.  The repository has grown to be too large and people
working on one part may not need the other part. The following steps
would convert it to a product comprising two components,
namely 'doc' and 'src'.
.LP
Create a file which defines the partition boundaries.  Call it components:
.DS
$ cat components
# These are the partition boundaries
doc
src
$
.DE
Then run the command to transform the partition.
.DS
$ bk partition -Ccomponents
.SH CATEGORY
.B Nested
.SH AVAILABILITY
This command is an optional feature of \*[BK]
and must be enabled in your license.
To see if your license has this enabled, run 
.DS
bk lease renew
bk lease show
.DE
If the options field has "nested" listed then your
license has this feature enabled.
If not, contact BitMover sales.
