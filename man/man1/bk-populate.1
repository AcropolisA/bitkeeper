.SH NAME
bk populate \- fill in components in a sparse product repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk populate
.[B] \-lqr
.[OPTreq] \-A alias \ ...
.[ARG] from \ .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The populate command is used to add components to a sparse product,
or to reclone all components implied by the cached aliases list.
.LP
When cloning a product, it is possible to clone a subset of it by 
specifying one or more aliases.
If later you want to add another alias, the populate command
can help:
.DS
$ bk clone -Adev-tools bk://server/big-product
$ cd big-product
$ bk populate -Adebugger
.DE
After running the above, the cached aliases list will be
"dev-tools" and "debugger".
If you need to populate a module that is not present in your parent[s],
add one or more trailing urls (populate will use each url in turn until
all requested modules are found):
.DS
$ bk populate -Mblimey bk://uk-server/big-product
.DE
.LP
The set of modules populate will consider are specified on the command line with
.BR \-M ,
or retrieved from the cached modules list with
.BR \-r ,
or implied by the "default" modules database entry if neither of
the former apply.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \-M\*<module\*>
.B \-l
Populate using hard links instead of copying the data.  
This is faster and saves disk space, but only works 
within filesystems supporting hard links.
.tp
Add this alias to the list of components that should be
in this product instance.
This option may be repeated to add more than one alias.
.tp
.B \-q
Run quietly.
.tp
.B \-r
Repair the product by replacing any components which listed in
the cached modules list that have been manually removed.
