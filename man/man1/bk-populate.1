.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The populate command is used to add one or more modules to
a sparse product clone or to make sure that all components
implied by the cached modules list are present.
.LP
When cloning a product, it is possible to clone a subset of it by 
specifying one or more modules.
If later you want to add another module, the populate command 
can help:
.DS
$ bk clone -Mdev-tools bk://server/big-product
$ cd big-product
$ bk populate -Mdebugger
.DE
After running the above, the recorded list of modules will be
"dev-tools" and "debugger".
.LP
If you have removed a component by mistake, just running the 
populate command with no arguments will reclone any missing components.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \-E\*<env\*>=\*<val\*>
.OPTequal \-E env val
Export an environment variable to the 
.B bkd
running in the remote \*(BK repository.
Typically used to pass information to remote triggers.
Only variables with the prefix
.V BKU_
are allowed.
This option may be repeated to set more than one variable.
.tp
.B \-l
Populate using hard links instead of copying the data.  
This is faster and saves disk space, but only works 
within filesystems supporting hard links.
.tp
.OPTreq \-M module
If present, add this module to the list of modules that should be
in this product instance.
This option may be repeated to add more than one module.
.tp
.B \-q
Run quietly.
