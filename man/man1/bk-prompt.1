.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bk prompt
is used to prompt a user with a message, get a positive or negative response,
and exit accordingly.
.LP
This interface may be used for either command line or graphical environments.
.LP
If the environment variable 
.V BK_GUI
is set, then the graphical version will be used instead of the command
line version.
All of the \*[BK] GUI tools set this variable automatically such that any
call to bk prompt from inside the graphical tools will result in a
graphical prompt, including the execution of any user supplied triggers.
.LP
If the environment variable 
.V BK_MSG_GEOM
is set, the graphical tool will use the
value of this variable to locate itself on the screen.  The format of the
variable must be in the form 
.I +x+y
where "x" and "y" are screen coordinates. 
.B bk citool
sets this variable 
automatically such that the prompt will be at the same x/y location as
the upper left corner of citool.
