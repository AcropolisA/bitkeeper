.SH NAME
bk pull \- update a repository from its parent[s]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk pull [\-iqRt] [
.OPTequal \-E env var
.Bc ] [\-z[
.ARGc d
.Bc ]] [
.OPTreq \-c n
.Bc ] [
.ARGc parent
 ...\c
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Pull updates a repository from its incoming parent[s].
Changes are retrieved and automatically applied, if possible.
You will only be asked to resolve conflicts by hand if a file
has overlapping changes (changes where both repositories have
touched the same line in the same file).
.LP
To see what would be pulled run
.DS
bk changes -R
.DE
.LP
Pull normally runs resolve, the tool which applies the pulled changes,
automatically.  Resolve will look at each change, make sure there are
no conflicts that it can't merge, and apply the change.  You may have to
(or want to) run resolve manually.  If you do not want automatic merges,
i.e., you want to diff them by hand, then use the \-i option.  If resolve
was run automatically and it found conflicts, the changes have _not_ been
applied; you will need to run an interactive resolve to merge and
apply the changes.
.LP
You can override the default parent by specifying a different one.
Doing so changes the parent for the duration of this command only.
.LP
If you've pulled in error you may use bk unpull to remove the
changesets introduced by the pull.
Note! bk unpull will unpull the merge changeset, if any, discarding any
merge work you may have done.
