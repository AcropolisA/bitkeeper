.SH NAME
bk push \- send local changes to parent repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk push [\-agqt] [
.OPTequal \-E env var
.Bc ] [\-z[
.ARGc d
.Bc ]] [
.OPTreq \-c n
.Bc ] [
.ARGc parent
 ...\c
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Push sends changes in the current repository back to its parent[s] if
and only if the current repository is a superset of the parent.
When a parent has changes not found in the current repository,
push will fail and you will need to do a bk pull, merge those changes,
and retry the push.  The idea is that the parent is typically a shared
resource and should not be locked for merging.
.LP
If there is no new work in the parent, then all changes in the child
will be sent to the parent and auto\-applied.
.LP
To see what would be pushed run
.DS
bk changes -L
.DE
.LP
You can override the default parent by specifying a different one.
Doing so changes the parent[s] for the duration of this command only.
.LP
You can override the no\-merge policy by going to the parent and doing
a 
.B bk pull
and specify the child as the 
.BR bk\ parent .
.SH OPTIONS

If the parent is ahead of your repository, turn the push into a pull

.ARG n
times before giving up (default forever).
.tp
.OPTequal \-E env val

Run quietly.
.tp
.B \-t
Pass 
.B \-t

means do not use the GUI tools) during
the pull operation (requires
