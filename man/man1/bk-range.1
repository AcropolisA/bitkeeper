.SH NAME
bk range \- demo program to show ranges & dates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk range
.[B] \-q
[\c
.OPTreq \-c range 
|
.OPTreq \-r rev ]
.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Many commands may take as arguments date ranges or graph differences.
The
.B graph difference
between revision
.ARG A
and revision
.ARG B
is the set of deltas in
.ARG A 's
history that are not in
.ARG B 's
history.
You may specify deltas
by revision number (1.2), delta key
('amy@bitmover.com|man/man1/bk-terms.1|20020714011327|59990'), a
symbolic name (@tag), changeset revision (@1.33), or changeset key
(@'lm@disks.bitmover.com|ChangeSet|20020912140445|17593').
The graph difference between revisions
.ARG A
and
.ARG B
is represented by the notation
.ARGc B
.Bc .\|.\|
.ARG A ,
as in:
.DS
bk changes -r1.1820.2.1..1.1822
.DE
.LP
See \*(lqgraph difference\*(rq in
.B bk help terms
for more information.
.LP
You may specify a date range this way:
.DS
bk log -c1998/..2002/
.DE
.LP
The date format is [+\-]YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MM:SS with missing fields either
rounded up or rounded down.
Optionally, you can append a time zone offset of the form -ZH:ZM for
negative offsets from GMT or +ZH:ZM for positive offsets.
Rounding is explicit if there is a \*(lq+\*(rq (rounds up) or a
\*(lq\-\*(rq (rounds down) prefix on the date.
If there is no prefix, then the rounding is context sensitive.
The starting date is rounded down and the ending date is rounded up,
so 2001/..2001/ is the same as 2001/01/01-00:00:00..2001/12/31-23:59:59.
.LP
Note: the date parsing code looks for digits followed by a non-digit for
each field.    
Older versions of \*[BK] allowed dates in the format YYMMDDHHMMSS and
we still support that for old scripts but doing so meant we had to require
a clear delineator between year and month.
.LP
Note: the mixing of dates and revisions is deprecated.
.LP
If there is only one date specified, without a revision, then a 
very useful form of the date is to specify a recent period of time, 
such as 
.DS
bk log \-c\-1d
.DE
.LP
which will display the last 24 hours worth of changes.  This works
the same way for Years/Months/days/hours/minutes/seconds, i.e.,
.DS
.\" Using spaces for alignment here because the single tab was spazzing out
In the last year:       log \-c\-1Y (or \-1y)
In the last month:      log \-c\-1M
In the last week:       log \-c\-1W (or \-1w)
In the last day:        log \-c\-1D (or \-1d)
In the last hour:       log \-c\-1h
In the last minute:     log \-c\-1m
In the last second:     log \-c\-1s
.DE
If you leave off the multiplier, 1 is assumed.
.LP
While you may not build up specific dates as \-1Y2m3d, you can specify 
fractions, i.e., to get the last 6 months worth, try
.DS
bk log \-c\-.5Y
.DE
.\" .LP
.\" You can mix and match revisions and date.  If you want everything in
.\" 98, but not past revision 1.5, you would type:
.\" .DS
.\" bk log \-c98 \-r1.5
.\" .DE
.LP
Dates can also be in the form of symbolic tags (ChangeSet file only).  
If you tagged a changeset with Alpha and another changeset with Beta,
you can type:
.DS
bk changes \-cAlpha..Beta
bk log -r@Alpha..@Beta foo.c
.DE
.LP
Ranges need not include both endpoints.  If you wanted to see everything
from Beta forward, you could type:
.DS
bk changes \-cBeta..
.DE
.LP
A single
.QR \-r ,
because it is the first revision seen, rounds down and means
1.1.  To get the most recent delta, type
.QR \-r+ .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP \-c\*<range\*>
.OPTreq \-c range
Specify deltas by a date range
.tp
.OPTreq \-r rev

.tp
.B \-q
run quietly; default is to warn about all files which do not match the range
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
.B bk range
returns exit status:
.TP
0
on success.
