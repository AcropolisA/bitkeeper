.SH NAME
bk renametool \- graphical tool for finding renames
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk renametool \<
.ARG filelist
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The renametool command is a graphical interface for finding renames.
Renametool is invoked automatically by the import command when
importing patches.
.LP
The purpose of this tool is to maintain revision history across file
renames.  A repository which is managed entirely by \*(BK manages
revision history across file renames. However, a system managed by
BitKeeper, but which imports traditional patches (i.e. diff \-Nur)
needs some help because patches do not directly record renames.
.LP
Conceptually, a patch rename is seen as a deletion of one file and a
creation of another file.  When \*(BK imports a patch, it detects
the set of created and deleted files.  These files are then fed to
renametool where you are given the chance to find files which are
actually renames and record that information.  
.LP
When renametool starts up, you are looking at several text windows.
The game is that you need to match up files in the create window with
files in the delete window.  You can click on files in each window
and the tool will show you diffs.  When you find two files which
you think are the same, you can click the rename button to rename
them and remove them from the lists.  The guess button tries to find
matches for you, based on the basename of the files.  When you click
on a created file, the guess button is invoked once automatically.
You can click on the guess button again to find the next potential
match.
.LP
After you have matched up every file there is to match up, click
"create all" and "delete all" to finish up any stragglers, and then
click apply.
