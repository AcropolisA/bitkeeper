.SH NAME
bk repair \- attempt to repair a repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk repair
.OPTreq \-@ url
.ARG repo
.SH DESCRIPTION
Because \*[BK] files are stored in the file system they are sometimes
mistakenly removed or moved, resulting in an inconsistent repository.
The 
.B bk check
command will complain about missing files or deltas.
.LP
The
.B bk repair
command attempts to restore the missing files from the parent
repository (or repositories if there are multiple parents).
If the parent is at the same point, or ahead of, the repository being
repaired then the repair will succeed.  
If the parent is behind the repository being repaired then the repair
may fail if the missing files contained work unique to the damaged
repository.
.LP
The 
.B bk repair
command expects to be run in a repository but an alternative repository
may be named on the command line.
.LP
If the repository has nothing to repair the command will exit silently.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-@\*<url\*>

0 on success, non-zero on failure.
