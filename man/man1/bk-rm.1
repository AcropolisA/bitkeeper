.SH NAME 
bk rm \- remove \*(BK file[s]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk rm
.ARG file1
.FILES
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To delete a file, do this:
.DS
$ bk rm foo.c
.DE
Removing the file actually moves it to
.if t .IR BitKeeper/deleted/del-foo.c .
.if n BitKeeper/deleted/del-foo.c.
All future operations will ignore the file unless you name it
explicitly, but it will still exist in the repository and will still be
propagated by
.BR  resync .
To resurrect the file, simply rename it again:
.DS
$ bk -R mv BitKeeper/deleted/.del-foo.c `pwd`/foo.c
.DE
Edited files can not be deleted, you must check them in first.
.LP
If you wish to obliterate all traces of a file, use the 
.B bk gone
facility.
.SH NOTE
.B bk rm
will not remove directories, use
.B bk rmdir
for that.
.SH SEE ALSO
