.SH NAME 
bk rm \- remove \*(BK file[s]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk rm
.ARG file1
.FILES
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To delete a file, do this:
.DS
$ bk rm foo.c
.DE
Removing the file actually moves it to
.if t .IR BitKeeper/deleted/.del-foo.c~293843edf341df .
.if n BitKeeper/deleted/.del-foo.c~293843edf341df.
All future operations will ignore the file unless you name it
explicitly, but it will still exist in the repository and will still be
propagated by
.BR  resync .
Edited files can not be deleted, you must check them in first.
.LP
If you wish to obliterate all traces of a file, use the 
.B bk gone
facility.
.LP
To resurrect the file, use bk unrm.
.DS
bk unrm foo.c
.DE
.SH NOTE
.B bk rm
will not remove directories, use
.B bk rmdir
for that.
