.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk rset
.[OPT] \-ah 
.OPTreq \-r rev
.br
.B bk rset
.[OPT] \-ah 
.OPTreq \-l rev
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bk rset
is used to generate a view of either the changes contained in a particular
changeset, the changes contained in a sequence of changesets, or a view
of the entire repository as of a particular changeset.
.LP
To see the changes made by a particular change, try
.DS
$ bk rset -r1.201
ChangeSet|1.200..1.201
src/gui/fmtool.tcl|1.17..1.21
.DE
.BR Note :
the first revision listed in the 1.17..1.21
is the revision of the last delta created before the start of the
specified changeset.  It is done this way so that programs which
parse this output know where the last changeset stopped.  It is also
worth noting that \*(BK changesets can contain multiple revisions to 
the same file, which is why the end of the last changeset and the start
of the requested changeset is listed in the output.
.LP
This program is not normally run by users, the 
bk export command uses 
.B bk rset
combined with
.nh
.B bk gnupatch
.hy
to generate traditional patches.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-a
show deleted files which are normally suppressed.
.tp
.B \-h
show the ``historic'' paths of the file as well as the current path.
This makes the output look like
.ARGc current
|\c
.ARGc start
|\c
.ARGc rev
|\c
.ARGc end
|\c
.ARG rev .
The output has three file names:  current, starting, and ending; 
corresponding to the current pathname,
the pathname of the file at the start of the first changeset listed, 
and the pathname of the file at the end of the last changeset.
.tp
.OPTreq \-l rev
list the entire repository as of changeset 
.ARG rev .
Mutually exclusive with
.BR \-r .

changed in this changeset.
.tp
.OPTreq \-r r1\fB,\fIr2

changed after changeset
.ARG r1
