.SH SYNOPSIS

.BKARGS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B bk sccslog
is used to get a time sorted listing of changes over all of the specified
or implied files.  It is similar to
.BR "bk log" ,
with the difference being
that
.B bk log
respects file boundaries, i.e., lists all changes in a file 
before going on, but
.B bk sccslog
sorts the changes and prints each change
in time order, ignoring file boundaries.
It is useful to go to a directory and type:
.DS
bk sccslog -c-1M
.DE
to see what has happened in all of the files there in the last month.
.LP
By default,
.B bk sccslog
runs the output through your pager, which can
be controlled with \s-2$PAGER\s0.
