.SH NAME
bk sendbug \- file a \*(BK bug report
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bk sendbug
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This command should be used to file a bug report rather then sending
mail to one of the developers.
.LP
This is a interactive command, a template will be displayed in your editor,
and you fill in the details.
.LP
The bug database is online at
.B http://www.bitkeeper.com/ 
scroll down and click on the
.B Bug Database
entry.  
The bug database is also available via email, consult the web page for
more information.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
At some point, we will offer a more polished version of the bug system
as a \*(BK add on.  Everyone wants a bug system which ties into changesets,
we know that, we want it too.
.SH EXAMPLE
An example template looks like this:
.sp
.nf
