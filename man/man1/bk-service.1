.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \*(BK daemon, bkd, is used to synchronize and query repositories.
See bk help bkd for information on the \*(BK daemon.
.LP
.B bk service
is used to install (and start), uninstall (after stopping), query the status
of a named \*(BK daemon (bkd), or list all installed daemons.
The main reason for using this interface is to get a service that will be
restarted on each boot.
.SH MULTIPLE DAEMONS
It is possible to install more than one \*(BK daemon, which is useful if
you want different permissions on different repositories.
All daemons must have a name, and the name must be unique across the 
set of \*(BK daemons.
The default name is "BKD".
The names are stored in the registry and we suggest a single word, using mixed
case if you want to a name like "MyBitkeeperDaemon".
.LP
Some commands take an optional "-a" instead of a name which means operate on
all installed \*(BK daemons.
.SH PERMISSIONS
By default, an installed service is run as LocalSystem which is a system 
user, not the user who installed the service.  This can lead to problems
if the BKD is used to serve up repositories created by the user with
permissions restrictive enough that the LocalSystem user cannot access
some or all the files in the repository.
.LP
There are two ways around this problem, either create all the repositories
through the BKD so they are all owned by LocalSystem, or change the service
to be run as the user who owns the repositories, described below.
.SH RUNNING AS A SPECIFIC USER
.LI
The user account must have a password.  If not, go to 
Control Panel->User Accounts, select the user, and create a password.
Close that window.
.LI
The user account must be allowed to log on as a service.  This is not
on by default, so go to Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local
Security Policy->Local Policies and double click on User Rights Assignments.
Find "Log on as a service" and double click that.  Click "Add User or Group"
and add the user.
Close that window.
.LI
The service needs to be modified to run as the user.  Go to Control
Panel->Administrative Tools->Services, find the \*(BK daemon, double
click it.
Click stop to stop the service, then
click the "Log On" tab, change from "Local System account"
to the user, entering the password as well.
Click Apply.
Click the "General" tab and then click start.  
The daemon will restart as the selected user.
.LP
After installing a service it is a good idea to test that it works by 
trying a clone, pull, and/or changes from a client.
.SH NOTES
This interface works only on Windows.
.LP
Environment variables must be explictly passed on the bkd options list,
i.e.,
.DS
bk service DOCS -EBK_USER=docs -p8000
