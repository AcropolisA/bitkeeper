.LP
Xflags is an administrative command used to check and/or fix BitKeeper 
flags.  These flags control things such as what sort of keywords are
expanded.

This command should not be typically needed, it exists to fix older
repositories which did not properly maintain these flags.  If bk check 
yields output like

src/utils/README@@1.3 should have SCCS flag
src/DOCS: missing required flag[s]: BITKEEPER
