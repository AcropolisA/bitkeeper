In order to get the sorting that Beth wants (and CVSweb does), we need to
wack sccslog.  There are two changes needed:

a) -r<rev>, this needs to be a range enabled rev.  In the BKweb case,
   we would always do -r+.

b) -s<sort field> where <sort field> is rev|user|date|filename

c) prs dspec usage for the printing of the results.  This one is a little
   more complicated, we need to save the sccs *s to make it work.  In order
   to not run out of memory, we need to sccs_close(s) to do the unmmaps.
   Then we need a way of going from delta to sccs* so we can pass that in.
