Ordering of deltas
	The latest delta is TOT.
	If TOT has multiple metadata deltas, it is the latest meta.
	a Meta delta implies that delta and all earlier deltas until
	one which is found in prev changeset

Steps involved in creating a changeset
    a) determine the set of files which have changed (or been created)
       since the last changeset.
       Include the about-to-be-created ChangeSet delta itself.

    b) Create the new ChangeSet file with the id for the about to be created
       delta.

    c) Create the delta, using an Init file to get the id right.

Steps involved in creating a patch
    a) Build up a list of file:delta pairs of stuff that needs to be in the
       changeset.
    b) build up a list of file:delta pairs of stuff in the previous changeset
    c) produce the difference.  This may include multiple deltas/file.

The changeset file format needs to be the complete set of root:version
pairs of keys which define the state of the tree when the changeset
was applied.  So a changeset which adds three file:deltas to a tree of
100 files, adds three lines to a 100 line file.  To get the state of the
tree at any point, you just get that changeset and convert those lines
into a set of checkouts on the file & rev.  Means that co needs to be
able to take a key as a rev.

Allow the use of tags to delimit boundries of a change set.
