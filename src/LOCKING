Reader/writer locking in BK.

This is repository wide locking, not individual file locking.

Writer lock
-----------

Currently "project/RESYNC", someday it it will be "project/BitKeeper/RESYNC".

Reader lock
-----------

BitKeeper/readers/<pid>-<hostname>

Locking stuff
-------------

When trying to get a writer lock, walk the reader list and kill 0 each
of them that are on the same host.  If they are all gone, then remove
them and let the lock succeed.

This means that the process who created the lock can't exit until all
of the child processes are done.

Places we need to lock:

	clone
	resync
	pull
	push
