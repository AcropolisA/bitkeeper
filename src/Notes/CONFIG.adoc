Managing configuration options
==============================

BK behavior on a local and macro scale is influenced by
configuration that can exist in files and an environment
variable.

To see all the documented options can be configured, look at

    bk help config-etc

To see all the places this config file can live:

    bk help config

To see all options (please fix if this misses any):

    bk -r grep proj_conf \
        | perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /proj_conf\S*\([^,]+,\s*"(\S+)"/' \
	| sort -u

A user can fetch a template to help them:

    bk setup -p > template

At this time, that's a minimal template

We might think about support alternate ways to support the user.
Examples:

   bk config --show-template[=basic,admin,full] > template

   bk configtool (then select which level you want to see)
