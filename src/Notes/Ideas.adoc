Propagating named branch delete when using LODs
===============================================

Figure out some way to delete a branches worth of deltas and
propogate that delete into other environments.  The propogation
should not occur of the deletes are in the default branch on 
default line of work.  Nor should they propogate if the deltas
are recent?
