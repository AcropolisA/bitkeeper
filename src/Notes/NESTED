        bk ensemble - create and manage SAM repository collections

        bk ensemble is part of the Scalable Asset Management feature of
        BitKeeper.  Blah, blah, blah.

        bk ensemble create [-q]         # creates product, no new root
                                        # works on .
                                        # touch BitKeeper/log/PRODUCT
        bk ensemble add [-q] -y<m>|Y<f> url loc ...
                                        # clones component, newroots
                                        # bk new loc
                                        # bk commit -y<m>|Y<f>
                                        # BitKeeper/log/COMPONENT
                                        # which contains `bk pwd -R`

Files on disk
	BitKeeper/log/PRODUCT - currently empty, marks a product root
	BitKeeper/log/COMPONENT - contains the relative path to the component
	BitKeeper/log/CSETFILE - normally contains `bk id` but in the case
	of a component contains `bk id` of the product.

	Note that all these things are going away and stored in a single
	BitKeeper/log/CACHE db file real soon now.
