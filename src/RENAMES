bk resync Remote Local

	Local		Remote		Case #
	not moved	not moved	1
	not moved	moved		2
	moved		not moved	3
	moved		moved		4

Case #
	a) does the user get involved?
	b) what happens?

Case 1
	Do nothing, no renames in either

Case 2
	a) user is not involved, but is warned that move is happening
	b) Make an rfile with a rename entry

Case 3
	a) user is not involved, but is warned
	b) Make an rfile with a rename entry

Case 4
	a) user needs to be consulted to see which to use
	   user can also pick a new name completely, so checks for
	   conflicts in others that exist need to be done.
	   This may cause a copy of sfiles from Local into RESYNC,
	   if the user wants to rename something not involved in the
	   patch (creating an additional case 4 entry from something
	   that had been case 1). 
	b) Make an rfile with a rename entry

The format of the rename (R.file) is

	local	gca	remote

After processing all sfiles,
    do for all files that have rfiles with rename entries:

 	move rfile and sfile to $PROJROOT/BitKeeper/rename/
	move them back to the RESYNC directory with the new name
	add deltas to the local and or remote branch so each match new name
	move over the wall into Local repository

Assumptions: Local and Remote are in same LOD

Notes from design discussion:
There are 4 namespaces: Remote, Local(before), Local(after), RESYNC.

RESYNC namespace is initially same as Remote.
After the move to and from BitKeeper/rename, RESYNC becomes Local(after).
