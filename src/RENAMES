Case #
	a) does the user get involved?
	b) what happens?

Case 1
	Do nothing, no renames in either

Case 2
	a) user is not involved, but is warned that move is happening
	b) Somehow, I need to remember that the local file needs to be
	   moved and do that as part of the apply process.

Case 3
	a) user is not involved, but is warned
	b) move the RESYNC file into the same location as the local file,
	   for now, error if that location is in use.

Case 4
	a) user needs to be consulted to see which to use
	b) if (use local name) {
		treat like case 3
	   } else {
	   	treat like case 2
	   }

The format of the rename (R.file) is

	local	gca	remote
