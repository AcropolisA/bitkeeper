mkpatch
    Given a list of deltas to generate a patch from
    	generate the parent UUID
	generate the PRS record
	generate the diffs
	generate any PRS records for associated removed deltas.
	

sccs_patch
    generates a patch for a particular revision.  A patch is 

	a) the parent key as a PRS record
	b) the PRS record for the delta
	c) any removed and/or meta PRS records
	d) the diffs in diff output but no changes, just adds and deletes.

tkpatch
    parses the patch file, the calls sccs_delta with a pointer to the diffs
    and the PRS record.

sccs_delta
    gets modified to have one more argument, the diffs pointer, which implies
    the FORCE flag.
