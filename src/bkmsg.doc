#monotonic
If a file is marked as monotonically increasing, and that file has "dangling
deltas", i.e., deltas which are ahead of the top changeset, then the monotonic
flag may not be removed unless the dangling deltas are removed first.  You
may remove those deltas with the following command:

    bk prs -hnd'$if(:DANGLING:){:GFILE:|:I:}' <file> | bk stripdel -dC -

and then you may remove the MONOTONIC flag.
$
#chk1
A file is marked as gone (in BitKeeper/etc/gone) but is present in your
repository, possibly missing some deltas.  This can happen if a different 
repository had lost the file, marked it as gone so that "bk -r check -a" 
would pass, and then your repository was updated with that information.
Since your repository still has the file, it may be possible to restore
it in the other repository if you wish.

The other case is that someone is trying to destroy all instances of the
file's revision history.  Suppose a large file were added by mistake,
perhaps a derived (compiled) file or binary.  

Examine the files listed and if it is clear the file is obsolete, remove
the revision history from your repository to be consistent with your parent.

If it is clear that the file is valuable then you should have the
owner of the other repository restore the file from your repository.
After the file is restored, remove the file identifier (root key) from
the BitKeeper/etc/gone file.  If you have only part of the revision
history then remove the root key from the BitKeeper/etc/gone but add
the missing keys with a

	bk -r check -aggg | bk gone -

$
#chk2
A pointer to a delta was found in the ChangeSet file but the delta was
not found in the corresponding file.  This should only happen if one or
more files have been lost in a repository, copied from another repository,
but they were incomplete.

To get the list of missing deltas, run "bk -r check -agg".

To see if any of the deltas exist in another repository, use "bk findkey".

If the deltas exist in another repository it is possible to migrate them
into your repository.  The process is to generate the list of changesets
which contain the missing deltas, make a patch, and apply the patch.
You should probably contact BitMover for help with this the first time
you try this process.

If the deltas cannot be found in any other repository, then you will
not be able to completely reproduce that changeset.  You can make
BitKeeper stop complaining about the problem by running

	bk -r check -agg | bk gone -

and then committing the changeset.
$
#chk3
One or more files are recorded as existing by the ChangeSet file but were
not found in the repository.  This can happen if the files were deleted,
either accidentally or on purpose.

If the files exist in another repository it is possible to add them back
to your repository.  The process is to find the files, copy them into
your repository, and strip off any extra deltas which should not be part
of your repository.  You should probably contact BitMover for help with
this the first time you try this process.

If the files cannot be found, or if the files were delibrately removed,
then the file identifiers (root keys) need to be added to the gone file.
Do this by running

	bk -r check -ag | bk gone -

and then committing the changeset.
$
#chk4
One or more files has LOD data in it.  The first approach we took to
LODs was not a good one and we are trying to remove all vestiages of
that approach.  Other than the MySQL repository, we know of no examples
of LOD usage at the current time.  If this is the MySQL tree, you may
safely run

	bk -r check -aff

to fix up your repository.  If it is not, contact BitMover.
$
#cset1
An attempt was made to include or exclude a merge changeset.
This is not currently supported.
If you would like to be able to exclude one side
of the merge, then please contact BitMover.
$
#write_perms
One or more directories which need updating do not have write permission.
Please examine the list and fix the permissions.

You can restart the resolve with a 

    bk resolve

after fixing the permissions.
$
#saw_blanknonl
The file #BKARG# is corrupted because of a bug in
BitKeeper version 3.0.1 and eariler.  It was caused by a 
file on Windows that has a carrage return as the last 
character of the file without a following newline.
Please contact BitMover by running 'bk support'
to request help in repairing this file.
$
#setup_1

You are about create a new repository.  You may do this exactly once
for each package stored in BitKeeper.  If there already is a BitKeeper
repository for this package, you should do

    bk clone package_dir my_package_dir

If you create a new package rather than resyncing a copy, you will not
be able to exchange work between the two packages.

$
#setup_2
Please create a description of this package.  A brief description is
probably best. For example:

    The Linux Kernel
or
    The GNU C compiler

If you are using a word processor to edit the package description,
please save the file as a plain text document.
$
#setup_3
Please fill out the configuration template in your editor.
This is used for support purposes as well as licensing.
$
#chkconfig_missing

Your BitKeeper package is missing the config file

    BitKeeper/etc/SCCS/s.config

This should not have occurred, but since it did, you can fix it
by doing the following:

    cp #BKARG#/bitkeeper.config BitKeeper/etc/config
    # edit it to reflect your site
    vi BitKeeper/etc/config
    bk new BitKeeper/etc/config

and then try this command again.

$
#chkconfig_inaccurate

Your config file, BitKeeper/etc/config, does not reflect your site.
Please check it out ("bk edit BitKeeper/etc/config"), modify it to
reflect your site, check it in, and try this command again.

$

#config_license
#license_none

You do not have a license for BitKeeper and the logging field in the
BitKeeper/etc/config file is not set to "logging@openlogging.org".
You either need a commercial license (to run without open logging),
or you need to convert your package to single user, or you need to
configure your package to use openlogging.  Until you have done one of
those, you may not create any changesets.

You can get a temporary license by sending a mail request
to sales@bitmover.com.

#open_log_query
This repository is configured to send changeset summaries to
	#BKARG#
so others can follow your work.  This is called Open Logging.

We need to get an OK from each user that it is OK to publish the
change logs.  You should say no if you are working on proprietary
and/or sensitive information that you or your employer would not
want made public.  If you are working on an Open Source project,
or any other project whose existence and status can be publicized,
you can say yes.

Saying no means the changeset will neither be logged nor be
created, which means a loss of the distributed functionality
of BitKeeper.  If it is important that you keep the information
private, you can contact BitMover for a closed use license.
BitMover can be reached at:

   888-401-8808 (toll free in the US & Canada) 
during business hours (PST) or via email at sales@bitmover.com.

Saying yes will send the changeset comments and per file comments.
It will NOT send your source code.
Saying yes also means that you are accepting the terms of the BKL,
the license under which you obtained this software.  You can read
that license by saying "bk help license" in another window.

If you have been asked before it is because we ask once per host.
$
#closed_log_query
This repository is configured to send ChangeSet summaries to

This address is not an Open Logging server, it is a private 
server, probably inside your company.  If you don't wish to
send summaries to that server, change the logging field in the
BitKeeper/etc/config file.

In order to create this changeset, you need to confirm that it
is OK to send logs to this host.

#duplicate_IDs
You need to figure out why you have two files with the same ID
and correct that situation before this ChangeSet can be created.
$
#undo_error

BitKeeper is unable to undo the requested changeset[s].  This is
usually because undoing the requested list of changesets would leave the
repository in an error state.  Please look at the error message below
and try to find a set of ChangeSets which will work.  The typical
problems are:

    - Removing a delta in the middle of the history which leaves
      a parentless child delta.
    - The merge delta and a portion of a branch is deleted which
      leaves two open branches in the ChangeSet file.
    - Removing a delta which is included by another delta.

It is frequently helpful to look at the ChangeSet file with sccstool to
get a feel for which changesets must be undone together to leave a clean
tree.

The error caused by this undo is:
$
#version
BitKeeper#BKARG#version is @version@
Built by: @builder@
Built on: @built_date@
$
#config_preamble
This is the BitKeeper configuration for this package.

Please take a minute to fill it out carefully, it needs to be accurate.

NOTICE: you really do want to fill this out, if something goes wrong
with your repository, or if someone changes the logging policy, we
send mail to the contact listed here for confirmation.

BitKeeper can maintain a log of your change comments (not your source,
just the comments) on a centralized server.  This is useful as your
project grows, it gives people a place to go see what is happening on
a per project basis.  This is especially useful for distributed developers.

$
#config_setup
The setup program is used when creating the initial package stored 
in BitKeeper.  Running this tool will create the master repository.
You may do this exactly once for each package stored in BitKeeper.  

If this package is already stored somewhere in BitKeeper, get out
of this tool and do the following:

        bk clone package_dir my_workarea

instead.

$
#config_description

Name of the project, such as "BitKeeper" or "The GNU C compiler".

$
#config_category

What (RedHat package) category this project fits into, if any.

$
#config_logging

Open Logging server.  This site is where users go to see the
ChangeSet comments for all instances of this repository.  This must
be logging@openlogging.org for usage under the terms of the BKL,
"bk help bkl" will show you the default licensing terms.  If this
repository is commercial it can be an internal email address or "none"
to disable logging.

$
#config_contact

Contact person for this project.  This is whoever is the person that
should be contacted with update information or contacted if BitKeeper
discovers a problem which requires local intervention.  Please make the
contact information accurate so we can support you.

$
#config_email

It is very important that this email address is filled out and accurate.
If someone converts your repository to open logging (which you may not
want), we will contact this email address for confirmation that you really
did want open logging.  If the email address is inaccurate and we get no
response from anyone else at your location after 90 days, then open logging
will be implicitly approved.

$
#config_street

Add your street address if you like, it is optional.

$
#config_hours

Business Hours when we can contact you if you left a phone number.

$
#config_single_user

If this field is set, all checkins will appear to be made by this user,
in effect making this a single user package.  Single user packages are
free from the logging constraint up to a maximum of 1000 files.  In order 
for the package to really be free, both the single_user and the single_host 
field need to be set.

$
#config_single_host

If this field is set, all checkins will appear to be made on this host.

$
#config_compression

Default compression algorithm for stored s.files is gzip.
If you want no compression, set this to "none".

$
#config_autofix

Default is to autofix problems found by check.
If you want to manually fix them, set this to "no".

#warn_poly
Warning: this repository has been found to have deltas which
belong to multiple csets (not an error, but annoying).
This happens if a repository with uncommitted deltas is copied
and then committed in both copies.
Please use only 'bk clone <from> <to>' to copy a repository.
$
#reserved
BitKeeper is unable to create a file with the following path name:
        #BKARG#
This usually happens if your path name contains a reserved name used on
the destination file system.  Known reserved names for FAT/NTFS/Samba/CIFS
file system are as follows:
        "aux", "con", "prn", "nul", "lpt?", "?:"
Please rename the file and retry (see also "bk helptool mv")
Note: You must do the rename in the sending repository.

#setuptool_step_BadUser
You are logged in as '#BKARG#'. You may not create repositories when
logged in as Administrator or root. Please log in as another user
before trying to create a repository.
$
#setuptool_step_Begin
You are about to create a new repository. Creating a new repository is
something which is done if the data which you wish to manage is not
already under BitKeeper control in a different repository. If there
already is a BitKeeper repository for this package, you should do the 
following:

bk clone package_dir my_package_dir

If you create a new repository rather than cloning a copy you will not
be able to exchange work between the existing and new repositories.
In other words, a repository is set up only once; after that you use
bk clone to get a copy of the repository


If you are ready to create a new BitKeeper repository, press Next.
$
#setuptool_step_EndUserLicense
Please take a moment to read the license agreement now. If you accept 
the terms below, click "I Agree", then "Next". Otherwise click Cancel.
$
#setuptool_step_LicenseType
BitKeeper provides three types of licensing. If you have received a bitkeeper
license key from BitMover, select "Commercial" and you will be prompted to
enter the key.

If you wish to use BitKeeper for free you must choose one of the other 
options. If you are a single user on a single host you may choose the
"Single User / Single Host" option in which case you will be prompted 
for a username and hostname. 

If you choose "Open Logging" you will not have to enter any data for the 
license, and all changes to the repository will be posted to openlogging.org
$
#setuptool_step_LicenseKey
Please enter the license key exactly as it was given to you. If this is a 
version 5 license key you must also enter the key signatures.

If the license keys are in a file, click the "From file..." button and the 
values will be extracted from the file. This should work even if the file 
has mail headers or other text, and is the easiest way to insure the keys 
are entered properly.
$
#setuptool_step_UserHostInfo
For single user / single host configurations you must enter a 
username and hostname. The username and hostname you supply will 
be recorded with every checkin in this repository.
$
#setuptool_step_RepoInfo
The following information uniquely identifies this repository. All fields 
are required to be non-empty in order for you to continue.

If the categories in the drop-down list do not meet your needs you may enter 
any category you like.
$
#setuptool_step_ContactInfo
The following information is optional.
$
#setuptool_step_Finish
There is now enough information to create the repository. Please review the 
following information. If it is correct, press the Finish button to create 
the repository.

The config file that is created will be saved as a standard revision controlled
file at BitKeeper/etc/config; it can be edited later to make changes. See the
config-etc manpage for detailed information on the format and options that
are supported. 
$
#setuptool_step_KeywordExpansion
BitKeeper can automatically expand SCCS or RCS keywords in files when they are 
checked out in read-only mode. This feature is off by default, but you can
change this behavior by selecting the expansion options that best meet your 
needs.

Select the "sccs" and/or "rcs" options to have the appropriate
keywords expanded. In addition, you can select "expand1" to mean you
only want keywords to be expanded in the first line that contains
keywords. This helps avoid conflicts with printf statements or other
code that may contain strings that look like keywords.
$
#setuptool_step_CheckoutMode
By default, gfiles will be visible in a repository unless they are checked
out. You can modify this behavior by defining the checkout mode.

A value of "get" will cause a "bk get <file>" command to be executed 
automatically after a "bk delta", causing the file to be checked out 
in read-only mode. 

A value of "edit" will prevent a checkin from removing the editable 
version of the file so that there is always an editable version of the 
file. 

A value of "none" will clear the gfile from the repository after a 
"bk delta". This is the default behavior.
$
#setuptool_step_Compression
By default, when you set up a repository the files in the repository are
compressed. If you do not wish for the s.files in your repository to be 
compressed you may turn this feature off by selecting "none".
$
#setuptool_step_Autofix
The bk check command can automatically fix a number of problems found
in a repository. By default this feature is turned on when a repository
is created. To turn this feature off select the value "no", in which case
the bk check command will not attempt to automatically fix problems it
detects.
$
#setuptool_invalid_license
The license key or license signatures are invalid. 
Please check the values that you entered. If you 
continue to have problems please contact BitKeeper 
support at support@bitkeeper.com.

Can not find a working mailer.

If you have access to a SMTP server, you can install the "blat" mailer
with the following command:

	blat -install <smtp_server_address> <your email address>

If you have a non-standard connection, you can supply a bk_mail.bat
file to connect BitKeeper to your mail server; the bk_mail.bat file
should accept the three auguments, as follows:

	bk_mail.bat file recipient subject

(recipient is a comma seperated list if there is more than one)

You should put the bk_mail.bat file in the BitKeeper directory.
The bk_mail.bat command should exit with status zero when the mail is
sent sucessfully.

#install-cygwin-upgrade
Thanks for installing BitKeeper.  We noticed that this was an upgrade
from an earlier version of BitKeeper.  Earlier versions of BitKeeper
required Cygwin (http://cygwin.com) and we did not uninstall Cygwin.

Versions 3.2.0 and later of Bitkeeper no longer require Cygwin in
order to function.  It is fine if Cygwin is left there, BitKeeper
doesn't need it but BK will work fine from a Cygwin shell.

We did not remove Cygwin as part of your upgrade because it is
common for people to have customized their Cygwin installation.
If you don't need or want Cygwin, the Cygwin documentation says that
you may remove Cygwin by manually removing the following items:

* The registry tree `Software\Cygnus Solutions' under
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and/or HKEY_CURRENT_USER .
* Anything under the Cygwin root folder, `C:\cygwin' by default.
* Anything created by setup in its temporary working directory.

For more information see http://cygwin.com/faq/faq0.html#SEC19
