#write_perms
=========================================================================
One or more directories which need updating do not have write permission.
Please examine the list and fix the permissions.

You can restart the resolve with a 

    bk resolve

after fixing the permissions.

$
#setup_1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You are about create a new repository.  You may do this exactly once
for each package stored in BitKeeper.  If there already is a BitKeeper
repository for this package, you should do

    bk clone package_dir my_package_dir

If you create a new package rather than resyncing a copy, you will not
be able to exchange work between the two packages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
$
#setup_2
--------------------------------------------------------
Please create a description of this package.  A brief description is
probably best. For example:

    The Linux Kernel
or
    The GNU C compiler

If you are using a word processor to edit the package description,
please save the file as a plain text document.
--------------------------------------------------------
$
#setup_3
--------------------------------------------------------
Please fill out the configuration template in your editor.
This is used for support purposes as well as licensing.
--------------------------------------------------------
$
#chkconfig_missing

Your BitKeeper package is missing the config file

    BitKeeper/etc/SCCS/s.config

This should not have occurred, but since it did, you can fix it
by doing the following:

    cp #BKARG#/bitkeeper.config BitKeeper/etc/config
    # edit it to reflect your site
    vi BitKeeper/etc/config
    bk new BitKeeper/etc/config

and then try this command again.

$
#chkconfig_inaccurate

Your config file, BitKeeper/etc/config, does not reflect your site.
Please check it out ("bk edit BitKeeper/etc/config"), modify it to
reflect your site, check it in, and try this command again.

$
#license_grace
Your license for BitKeeper has expired but you are still
within the grace period.  This changeset will be created
as normal, but you need to contact BitMover and purchase an
updated license.

BitMover can be reached in the United States at 415-401-8808
during business hours (PST) or via email at sales@bitmover.com.
Thanks!
$
#license_expired
Your license for BitKeeper has expired.  You are beyond the
grace period and you may not create any changesets until you
have contacted BitMover to purchase a license.

For more information, please run "bk helptool license"

BitMover can be reached in the United States at 415-401-8808
during business hours (PST) or via email at sales@bitmover.com.
Thanks!
$
#config_license
#license_none
You do not have a license for BitKeeper and the logging field in the
BitKeeper/etc/config file is not set to "logging@openlogging.org".
You either need a commercial license (to run without open logging),
or you need to convert your package to single user, or you need to
configure your package to use openlogging.  Until you have done one of
those, you may not create any changesets.

You can get a temporary license by sending a mail request
to sales@bitmover.com.  

BitMover can be reached in the United States at 415-401-8808

Thanks!
$
#open_log_query
This repository is configured to send ChangeSet summaries to
	#BKARG#
so others can follow your work.  This is called Open Logging.

We need to get an OK from each user that it is OK to publish the
change logs.  You should say no if you are working on proprietary
and/or sensitive information that you or your employer would not
want made public.  If you are working on an Open Source project,
or any other project whose existence and status can be publicized,
you can say yes.

Saying no means the changeset will neither be logged nor be
created, which means a loss of the distributed functionality
of BitKeeper.  If it is important that you keep the information
private, you can contact BitMover for a closed use license.
BitMover can be reached in the United States at 415-401-8808
during business hours (PST) or via email at sales@bitmover.com.

Saying yes will send the changeset comments and per file comments.
It will NOT send your source code.
Saying yes also means that you are accepting the terms of the BKL,
the license under which you obtained this software.  You can read
that license by saying "bk help license" in another window.

If you have been asked before it is because we ask once per host.
$
#closed_log_query
This repository is configured to send ChangeSet summaries to
	#BKARG#
This address is not an Open Logging server, it is a private 
server, probably inside your company.  If you don't wish to
send summaries to that server, change the logging field in the
BitKeeper/etc/config file.

In order to create this changeset, you need to confirm that it
is OK to send logs to this host.

If you have been asked before it is because we ask once per host.
$
#log_abort
Bitkeeper is aborting this commit.

This version of Bitkeeper is licensed for projects which wish to publish
their progress via Open Logging.  To purchase a copy of Bitkeeper without
the Open Logging feature, please contact sales@bitmover.com.  Thank you.
$
#seat_info
Your user count have exceeded the number of purchased licenses.

$
#duplicate_IDs
You need to figure out why you have two files with the same ID
and correct that situation before this ChangeSet can be created.
$
#consistency_check

BitKeeper is running a consistency check on your system because it
has noticed that this check has not yet been run on this repository.
This check is a one time event, but takes quite a while on large
repositories (approximately one minute per 1000 files).  

Please stand by and let the process finish (i.e. do not kill this process).

$
#undo_error

BitKeeper is unable to undo the requested changeset[s].  This is
usually because undoing the requested list of changesets would leave the
repository in an error state.  Please look at the error message below
and try to find a set of ChangeSets which will work.  The typical
problems are:

    - Removing a delta in the middle of the history which leaves
      a parentless child delta.
    - The merge delta and a portion of a branch is deleted which
      leaves two open branches in the ChangeSet file.
    - Removing a delta which is included by another delta.

It is frequently helpful to look at the ChangeSet file with sccstool to
get a feel for which changesets must be undone together to leave a clean
tree.

The error caused by this undo is:
$
#version
BitKeeper#BKARG#version is @version@
Built by: @builder@
Built on: @built_date@
$
#config_preamble
This is the BitKeeper configuration for this package.

Please take a minute to fill it out carefully, it needs to be accurate.

NOTICE: you really do want to fill this out, if something goes wrong
with your repository, or if someone changes the logging policy, we
send mail to the contact listed here for confirmation.

BitKeeper can maintain a log of your change comments (not your source,
just the comments) on a centralized server.  This is useful as your
project grows, it gives people a place to go see what is happening on
a per project basis.  This is especially useful for distributed developers.

$
#config_setup
The setup program is used when creating the initial package stored 
in BitKeeper.  Running this tool will create the master repository.
You may do this exactly once for each package stored in BitKeeper.  

If this package is already stored somewhere in BitKeeper, get out
of this tool and do the following:

        bk clone package_dir my_workarea

instead.

$
#config_description

Name of the project, such as "BitKeeper" or "The GNU C compiler".

$
#config_category

What (RedHat package) category this project fits into, if any.

$
#config_logging

Open Logging server.  This site is where users go to see the
ChangeSet comments for all instances of this repository.  This must
be logging@openlogging.org for usage under the terms of the BKL,
"bk help bkl" will show you the default licensing terms.  If this
repository is commercial it can be an internal email address or "none"
to disable logging.

$
#config_contact

Contact person for this project.  This is whoever is the person that
should be contacted with update information or contacted if BitKeeper
discovers a problem which requires local intervention.  Please make the
contact information accurate so we can support you.

$
#config_email

It is very important that this email address is filled out and accurate.
If someone converts your repository to open logging (which you may not
want), we will contact this email address for confirmation that you really
did want open logging.  If the email address is inaccurate and we get no
response from anyone else at your location after 90 days, then open logging
will be implicitly approved.

$
#config_street

Add your street address if you like, it is optional.

$
#config_hours

Business Hours when we can contact you if you left a phone number.

$
#config_single_user

If this field is set, all checkins will appear to be made by this user,
in effect making this a single user package.  Single user packages are
free from the logging constraint up to a maximum of 1000 files.  In order 
for the package to really be free, both the single_user and the single_host 
field need to be set.

$
#config_single_host

If this field is set, all checkins will appear to be made on this host.

$
#config_compression

Default compression algorithm for stored s.files is gzip.
If you want no compression, set this to "none".

$
#config_autofix

Default is to autofix problems found by check.
If you want to manually fix them, set this to "no".

#warn_poly
Warning: this repository has been found to have deltas which
belong to multiple csets (not an error, but annoying).
This happens if a repository with uncommitted deltas is copied
and then committed in both copies.
Please use only 'bk clone <from> <to>' to copy a repository.
$
#reserved_name
======================================================================
BitKeeper is unable to create a file with the following path name:
        #BKARG#
This usually happens if your path name contains a reserved name used on
the destination file system.  Known reserved names for FAT/NTFS/Samba/CIFS
file system are as follows:
        "con", "prn", "nul", "lpt?", "?:"
Please rename the file and retry (see also "bk helptool mv")
Note: You must do the rename in the sending repository.
