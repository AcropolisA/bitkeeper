# This script tests if a command has useful information spewed out if
# called with a --help

# This test should not kill the regression suite of tests, i don't think.

# basics:
# for every command
# run bk command --help and redirect all output to file
# if file contains DESCRIPTION/SYNOPSIS we know its a help file
# if it does not, we know that it didn't do the right thing.

exit 0
