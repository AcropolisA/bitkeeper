# NOTE: This should later be replaced by autoconf/automake scripts, but for
# the time being this is actually pretty clean. The only ugly part is
# handling CFLAGS so that the x86 specific optimizations don't break
# a build. This is easy to remedy though, for those that have problems.

#You can also customize the Twofish code.  All four combinations 
#of the flags are possible but only three of them make sense.
#
#Both undefined:  Very fast, requires ~4.2KB of ram per scheduled key
#Both defined  :  Slow, requires only ~100 bytes of ram per scheduled key
#
#If defined on their own
#_SMALL defined:  Very Slow, small code only ~100 bytes of ram
#_TABLES defined: Very fast, not faster than if both were undefined.  Code is ~1KB bigger
#                 faster keysetup though...

#ch1-01-6
# Small Ram Variant of Twofish.  For this you must have TWOFISH 
# defined.  This variant requires about 4kb less memory but 
# is considerably slower.  It is ideal when high throughput is 
# less important than conserving memory. By default it is not 
# defined which means the larger ram (about 4.2Kb used) variant 
# is built.
#CFLAGS += -DTWOFISH_SMALL

# Tell Twofish to use precomputed tables.  If you want to use 
# the small table variant of Twofish you may want to turn 
# this on.  Essentially it tells Twofish to use precomputed 
# S-boxes (Q0 and Q1) as well as precomputed GF 
# multiplications [in the MDS].  This speeds up the cipher 
# somewhat.
#CFLAGS += -DTWOFISH_TABLES

#Use fast PK routines.  Basically this limits the size of the private key in the
#DH system to 256 bits.  The group order remains unchanged so the best
#attacks are still GNFS (for DH upto 2560-bits)

#This will only speed up the key generation and encryption routines.  It lowers the
#security so its by default not turned on.  USE AT YOUR RISK!
