# NOTE: This should later be replaced by autoconf/automake scripts, but for
# the time being this is actually pretty clean. The only ugly part is
# handling CFLAGS so that the x86 specific optimizations don't break
# a build. This is easy to remedy though, for those that have problems.

#You can also customize the Twofish code.  All four combinations 
#of the flags are possible but only three of them make sense.
#
#Both undefined:  Very fast, requires ~4.2KB of ram per scheduled key
#Both defined  :  Slow, requires only ~100 bytes of ram per scheduled key
#
#If defined on their own
#_SMALL defined:  Very Slow, small code only ~100 bytes of ram
#_TABLES defined: Very fast, not faster than if both were undefined.  Code is ~1KB bigger
#                 faster keysetup though...

# Small Ram Variant of Twofish.  For this you must have TWOFISH defined.  This
# variant requires about 4kb less memory but is considerably slower.  It is ideal
# when high throughput is less important than conserving memory. By default it is
# not defined which means the larger ram (about 4.2Kb used) variant is built.

# Tell Twofish to use precomputed tables.  If you want to use the small table
# variant of Twofish you may want to turn this on.  Essentially it tells Twofish to use

#This used to be the zipup target. I have split it into two seperate targets:

#package. I have removed the dos2unix commands, as this is a Linux makefile,
#and these should not be needed. I also made it output the target to the
#current directory instead of the root (/) directory. (Bad Tom!) We are
#almost assured write permission in the current directory, but not in the root
#directory. This means any user can now build a BZ image or a zip.
